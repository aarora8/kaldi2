((first)) i'm going to   move into here and start heading toward the kitchen
  okay    
  yes  
  i think that i'm going to   move into  
  spreading the fire   romeo or bravo one romeo one  
  alright copy that    
  i think my fastest way out of here with this victim is to actually just bust through this outside wall
this area of the house because we have some fire in the kid's bedroom and a potential victim in the small bathroom so  
and there's already fire there so that's an explosion   so we get damage to the outside walls
there's no open doors over here i think my best bet is to make a hole in this wall so  
  so i'm going to use all my action points to     make two holes in the outside wall of the master bedroom
hm
and the fire
  okay i'm going to use one action point to open this door
  okay i'm going to move into the small bathroom   and i'm going to
  yeah that's it
  no not yet
i'm going to use my whole first turn to     put two damage markers on this outside wall
spreads
  the fire's spreading to bravo seven romeo three
further into the living room     we also need points of interest so   bravo five romeo five  
alright   i'm going to try to start moving this dog out so move
two to go in the master bath   three to move further in   and four to turn this one to smoke
copy
move again and check on this victim
oh right
and next time i'll move into the kid's bedroom and work on that fire and checking on this potential victim
so there's a person
  that's where   you just had some smoke in the game room is now fire next to a possible victim over
through the small bathroom into the kid's bedroom   i'll need to use another turn to get that dog out completely
and i'm going to bank an action point for my next turn
  the fire is spreading to bravo four romeo five
rolling for spreading the fire bravo seven romeo four
spreading the fire bravo six
    there's too much fire there you have to roll again
  so in the dining room and
  the fire is spreading to bravo seven romeo six
i think you have to put that out or turn it to smoke before you can step on it
romeo five
  bravo four   romeo five   so we have some smoke in the dining room
bravo six romeo three
  bravo six romeo five
bravo seven romeo six oh no that's smoke right on top of us
oh
there is smoke in the game room over
bravo six romeo three there's fire there that doesn't work
so that's fire in the kids' bedroom and this turns to fire too over
over
with me and this dog in the kid's bedroom over
bravo three romeo six
right
  another victim in the dining room
yes copy
  bravo eight romeo one
that's the kitchen
  we'll put them in the hospital
  a victim in the master bedroom and there's no fire in there over
  there's so-
yup
yeah maybe
yeah
i'm wondering if you should actually go back in since you're near that door and
okay
    yeah i think it's actually damage to this wall
start working on some of this fire in the kitchen so it doesn't explode again
    i think we're missing a door here
  and another damage to this one because it goes like all the way
do we have another door
that's an explosion
    alright   i'm going to continue heading   toward the outside door through the master bath
  yeah you can actually   put things out
  okay     i think i'm going to move into  
  yeah since it's next to fire
okay  
if you're not in the space but it's in a space that's adjacent to you
  alright  
i'm in the master bath i'm going to use one action point to put out that smoke another to move here     and two to put out this fire
  and into the master bedroom with this victim
start moving towards the kids' bedroom   because we have   a potential victim in the small bathroom   so since you're on that side of the house i'm going to
  i'm going to get this victim out
    okay i'm going to use four action points to  
  but i can't get her out on this   turn
with two actions so we saved another one get him to the hospital   and
  bravo one romeo six the fire is spreading
bust a hole through this outside wall and then get this person out on my next turn   so i still have one extra
  more fire in the kitchen    
use one action point to go in  
  let's see i think i might  
  you also need to roll for another potential victim since you saved someone
  spreading the fire bravo five romeo one
    we have some smoke in the dining room over
two to move
right
  okay    
three to move further and four to open this door
head into the master bath to check on that other victim since you're close to the one in the game room  
can you repeat that
  so there's smoke with me here in the master bath  
and that's my turn     rolling to spread the fire bravo two
  okay   i'm going to quickly put out this fire   i'm going to   move into the kitchen and
  it doesn't matter just one at a time  
okay
so i'll use two points to move into the master bedroom and get into the master bath on my   next go
bravo two romeo one
romeo one
  bravo two romeo one   there's another another explosion so the fire is spreading  
    bravo two   romeo one   is smoke next to fire in the living room so that turns to fire   so there's more fire in the living room over  
  turn this fire to smoke that's my whole turn spreading the fire   bravo six romeo one
  okay
  bravo two romeo four the fire's spreading  
  copy   alright i'm getting the dog out of the house for two points the dog is saved
damage to this wall
  bravo two romeo four ach   even more fire in the living room the living room is looking really bad  
  so there's smoke in the master bedroom
right hm
  copy      
so you're in the hospital
  over
and
  i'm going to move into the kid's bedroom through this hole i made in the wall
i think i'm going to go into the master bedroom to try to check on these potential victims
  we also need another potential victim   it looks like there's someone at bravo two romeo two
and we lost a victim
  so i have to roll for a point of interest   bravo six romeo three
  for one     use two points to put out this fire
so i'll use two points and start moving toward them
oh actually there's fire already there so   there wouldn't be anyone alive in that spot so   bravo four romeo six
  bravo six   romeo three
right
    when you're on the outside you can go around to any open door or bust a hole through the wall
    this would turn to fire as well
and one more to turn this fire to smoke  
it's    
    you need to roll for another point of interest over
more smoke in the kitchen
  and that's it
the fire is spreading to bravo eight romeo one
    ((yeah))
and for a point of interest   bravo three romeo five
    the fire is spreading to bravo one romeo two
bravo four romeo six there's a potential victim     here by the piano in the dining room over
  can i get a status report of the house
  bravo eight romeo one   so now we have some smoke in the master bedroom over
  so there's ready fire next to that that's more fire in the living room   and we need another   possible victim at bravo seven romeo four
bravo three romeo five
  okay i think i need to focus on this kitchen so we don't have any more explosions and then i'll try to get to those other victims
  over  
i'm going to put out
  bravo seven romeo four we have a possible victim in the game room o-
these two fires completely
that's you ^michael
  okay
  and
((then i'll)) bank one point over oh
  okay     now
oh can i oh yeah i can do that i'll turn that one into smoke   yeah okay so use my action points   and i'm going to roll for fire   bravo two romeo three
  okay so i'm  
  okay so i'm still going to work to extinguish this fire in the living room so i'm going to step forward   in in the corner here   i'll extinguish   that using three action points   and then i'm going to turn the fire

sorry to steal your save but   i didn't want to lose him     stepping into the master bedroom with my last point    
  alright that's romeo ahead game room   point of interest  
also making its way into the kitchen again over
point of interest next turn     the fire is spreading at romeo three   bravo seven so there's some smoke     in the game room now over

  alright so you have to re-roll on that one
more smoke in the master bath over
  alright oh man   i'm assuming the ~p ~o on the dining room is a little bit safe   master bath is looking a little worse situation with the smoke nearby
so i can get back to focusing on the fire in the living room that's looking really bad     it is spreading at bravo
  alright
towards the game room   exit i'm moving here into some smoke hopefully that'll hold   for now romeo four bravo two
alright

alright     things are starting to get a little
    we got more  
okay so i've reached the point of interest in the master bath    
  smoke turned into fire in the living room we've got a situation breaking out on that side of the house over
i still got a point banked that i forgot about
move them one step
you got really smokes nearby    
towards the door   i still have a point
  well i guess there hasn't been any more explosions so we're doing okay there i'm going to   extinguish the fire to my left in the living room
  oh that was only two action points so you got  
checking we do have a woman in the master bath     i only have two actions left for the turn but i am able to use both of them to get at least   one   one space closer to the exit i'm going to go out the master bedroom     i won't be able to finish it next turn but
left so i'll bank that for next turn
  we got fire
over
oh
romeo two

  alright going to take care of  
bravo seven
that's an explosion in the master bed
and turn this or get rid of this fir-   smoke completely  
oh okay yeah yeah
the two holes in the wall between the kitchen and the living room   and the dining room and the living room   so that's looking a lot better in my corner      
  some damage now
i will then step towards the kitchen to   hopefully handle that next turn
cool
  alright   first victim out over here in the game room        
i'll be able to get closer   fire is spreading at romeo six bravo four so   smoke next to smoke stays the same     just some more smoke filling up that same corner in the dining room over  
showing up again  
  that's right it actually c- it makes everything turn into fire
on the exterior over
      alright another woman brought to safety  
  god forbid the fire spreads and  
fire is spreading at romeo six  
what's that chief  
takes me down here romeo six   bravo three   fire now at the dining room door
and alright where am i stepping here you got kids' bedroom looking alright i'm going to step towards     the ~p ~o ~i in the dining room
next move i think i'm going to  
bravo seven
so smoke in the kids' bedroom turns into fire so the kids' bedroom is completely engulfed right now over
start chopping a wall
in the small bath the next turn i should be able to get in there and check   on this point of interest in there romeo four bravo three   alright explosion
over
  alright i'm going to step out   in the master bedroom and
start addressing this smoky dining room    
with that   extra action point that i had   just got to roll for another one
  (( )) i think we got the time  
a status update chief   alright     the kitchen's almost completely   engulfed in flames there's only two coordinates free there   like i said the kids' bedroom is now  
that that's two on top  
alright nothing worked there good good call romeo six bravo seven   alright
want to make sure we don't lose this point of interest even if it is a victim so and i'll use my last one to get rid of this smoke right where    
yup  
~p ~o ~i
romeo three
oh yeah s- you can bank that and you can grab one of these extra points over here so next turn you'll have five action
bravo three nope kitchen is a no-go zone
that's a new hospital record
dangerously placed point of interest in the kids' bedroom which is on fire   now fire at romeo one
completely on fire it's going to be tough to move through there     living room has patches of fire there    
that ~p ~o ~i is and   fire is spreading at romeo four   bravo eight so some smoke right by the  
romeo five
bravo one   alright another one appearing in the   in the dining room table   we got to look at that next turn over
  say that again  
moves  
three and a half three and a half left  
there you go
  our points of interest are located in the dining room  
bravo one   just some smoke there in the living room corner but the rest is on fire over
small bathroom and game room over
roll to get them on the board hopefully
~p ~o ~i i guess  
exit of the game room but hopefully isn't causing you any trouble over
alright
alright  
how many
two minutes to save two points of interest
nope
  alright due to that  
  okay sorry three minutes to save two points of interest copy
alright   alright i'm going to
oh that's right
fire spreading in the dining room i'm not going to be able to get the   victim out this turn but i'll use two
use my whole turn to get this woman to the door of the master bedroom unable to get her out just yet     i feel like after i next turn i do that i will start working on the living room a little bit
to get rid of that blocking my exit    
i'm going to
  oof
risk it and   and move one step closer to that exit hoping the fire doesn't     knock us out    
make sure we can contain some of the fire
  alright     now created enough space to get through this the exterior into the small bathroom   we have a false alarm there    
    ((well sh-)) i spoke too soon   we have   fire spreading at romeo two bravo two which is an explosion    
  alright
in light of that we saved another cat   ((yeah)) that's three cats on a day
romeo five bravo six   is where the fire is spreading and that's an explosion in the kids' bedroom     because there's already  
mhm
the redhead  
makes the fire spread to
  here's another ~p ~o ~i romeo five   bravo one  
correct
that's alright by me  
in that case i got one more step to take   and i'll take into the dining room   another point of interest at romeo two bravo seven  
a few more coordinates in the living room and damaging    
all coordinates completely engulfed in flames there's going to be damage   on all the walls in there   in between the small bathroom kids' bedroom the kitchen and the kids' bedroom dining room and to the exterior
  great because we got our twin out already i can i can i can see that they're   they're looking they're looking to be together again   alright we got a dog
all three ~p ~o ~is are unidentified and they're all in the living room fire though
the wall between the master bath and the living room
  okay i'm going to ignore this ~p ~o ~i   for now and turn my
  so i'll definitely check on that once i'm out
  with the victim next turn over  
right in the master bedroom near the smoke   and romeo two bravo one  
romeo six bravo seven
oh yeah and because it's next to fire we're going to flip it over into fire
and our false alarm   in the dining room
  rats alright going to step out one two three  
interest to   the kitchen
now the kids' bedroom is fully on fire we got the door closed between the living room or the dining room though so we're a little bit safe over
over
    just be able to move a little bit closer to the exit got to roll for another ~p ~o ~i here
unfortunately
got to make my way in here with you   two to work on in the dining room we'll check
which now all the doors have been blown open due to explosions  
alright that's not good for you here
((explosion)) in the kitchen   this door is blown open we've got  
  alright   this is red fire fighter  
  are you over green
some damage to these walls some we got some more damage to the wall over there over
  alright    
    i think
i'm going to remove a smoke step forward remove some more smoke   and then step into the kitchen and start working on this fire in the walls next turn   let's see where the fire is spreading
excellent i'm going to go first here so i'm going to step into the master bedroom   remove some smoke
  and i'm going to open this door between the master bedroom and the master bath     i see a point of interest in there   let me roll for fire     romeo three   bravo five
bravo two romeo three  
  some smoke right behind me   i must have left that there over  
oh man  
that's bad luck  
alright     i'm getting this dog out   the dog's been saved
alright we have our first explosion in the kitchen   so fire is spreading and there's some damage to these walls
  i got two points left so i'm going to  
step into this master bedroom and clean this up     try and get some of that fire out let's see where the ~p ~o ~is are spreading   bravo four romeo five
  over
    we lost another one
  and it spread there so blow this door open  
  it was the dog  
shoot
  so we have a ~p ~o ~i in the dining room there's two of them there now   and bravo six romeo one is where the fire is spreading that's smoke right below me good thing i got rid of that smoke this turn over
  it's a dangerous place
  alright i'm going to remove this fire   i'm going to step forward and turn this fire to smoke   and make my way repairing some walls and getting rid of fire as i go     try and to get to that
what are you doing in there green
  sounds good
  i think your turn is done  
((alright)) sounds good
  alright i'm going to save this person   we've saved another victim so that's good   i'm going to come in  
point of interest in the game room
bravo four romeo three  
wow smoke turns to fire right where i'm standing i'm knocked out  
i'm going to stand right outside the game room remove some of this fire    
  alright i'm stepping into the master bath let me see who this is we do have a victim in the master bath     i can't get her out yet   so i'm going to bank an extra point       and i'm going to see where the fire is spreading also   to bravo one romeo three so a little bit of smoke right behind you there green over
over
i have one turn left instead of stepping into that fire hazard i'm going to bank an extra point for next turn and really go at it   so let's see where we get another point of interest there're two points of interest
  alright i'm going to remove this smoke here in the master bedroom i'm stepping forward removing some fire   the master bedroom is getting under containment    
i think when i'm done with it i'll come into the master bath and maybe help you in the kitchen there we'll see    
bravo eight romeo three   so ooh someone's in the danger zone of the   game room there
bravo six romeo five  
and   bravo eight   romeo five
alright   i'm stepping into the game room getting rid of some fire   i'm going to check on this point of interest it was a false flag in the game room   so let me roll for another point of interest   bravo five   romeo five
there's an explosion in the kids' bedroom  
and someone's in the relative safety of the small bathroom   fire is spreading at bravo six romeo five  
mostly damage to walls  
alright over  
an explosion   wow   we need to work on these walls they are just coming down at this point
  there's a point of interest here in the dining room
  can you repeat chief how much time do we have
  and fire is spreading at bravo eight romeo two   we have an explosion in the bedroom
  over
alright we got to get on this over  
so we got   i'm going to need some damage counters
  alright   so i'm going to use two points to move   this victim towards the
damage to this wall damage to this wall this door is blown open   and the fire has spread h-   here
shoot
wall i'm going to put a hole in the wall with two points    
over
  yeah

move in see what this is
and let me see what the fire is doing we're at   bravo four romeo five
hm
person and i'm going to turn this into smoke
over
and i'm over
yes over
okay then i'm going to go ahead and take this person
okay i'm going to
towards the exit and also put out a little smoke
take out
okay
some smoke
that sounds good
and
over
turn some fire into smoke
and   then see what the fire's doing we're at
((situation)) is at bravo   four   romeo   six   alright looks like the piano caught fire
into the living room to try to ex- try to control that fire in the kitchen one   and i'll put out this fire here
  copy that
  alright well i'm going to put out these two fires right next to me
for two  
  but that's a slightly more manageable situation     over  
and then to make my way towards the kitchen   and that is all of my actions so i'm now going to roll for fire   at bravo four romeo   four and right off the bat we have an explosion   so this door opens
  alright so i'm now going to roll for fire
  bravo two romeo one another explosion oh boy  
  indeed   alright i am making my way out with the person from the living room so we have another person saved       i'm going go back into the go back living room after this one and see if we can ((try to)) control this fire somewhat   i've got
  got it alright i'm mov-   alright mov- moving in thr- moving through the kid's bedroom
yup
bravo three romeo three
  opening this here door  
  fire extends to the master bathroom
the fire right in front of me
this wall
  alright i i'm going to check out this point of interest in the
this fire spreads this way hits that wall we have fire
is now hit (()) two   and fire extends this way as well
another point of interest at bravo
small bathroom next time around   and let's see what's going on in the rest of the house   bravo five
  yeah i put it out the first time but it doesn't look like that it   has been under control     no worries
five   romeo one no i do not because that shower is on fire *ain't nothing going on there   at bravo five romeo four nope kitchen table that's also ablaze
here
  over
and here   and so it's going to be more fun for me next round   over  
  are we f- are we missing a point of interest on this here map  
romeo six it looks like some smoke
  alright so i'm going to put that fire out
happening in the dining room   which makes sense because it's it's getting hotter in there over
    copy that
to   i am going to go   go into the belly of the beast
  oh man bravo five   romeo
((alright)) i think we can we can manage that in the meantime alright i'll check out this point of interest   see what's going o- yes there is a person in   the living room
alright i am going to go investigate that point of interest in the dining room
  yeah you have to do one to flip it when you're on and then one to move then one to flip again
  ha no worries  
three
over
  ((are there))
and
oh that poor
  and then i'm going to check it out on the next time around   and so i'm going to   now   roll for fire  
go to look to where it looks like it started at the stove and at least reduce that to smoke for now     rolling for fire   at bravo one romeo one so it looks like we've some more flames going on in the living room the couch is now partially on fire   over
oh boy
potential person in the kitchen it's going to be hard to get them out of there but     i think we might be able to do it
  yup  
  that's right and yup  
and there are three points of interest if you want to see if investigate that or put out a fire  
(( )) so in the meantime it's rolling for fire
ye- yes good point   as i make my way   towards the door
at bravo two romeo one   and it looks like   there's some the fire in the living room is spreading over
brav- bravo five  
  i think that's just one
with the person i'm now going to roll for another point of interest  
  romeo six another explosion   of the heater next to the piano  
yeah and then this one actually might be two  
mhm
oh boy
  at bravo
the master bedroom yup
  have that (()) check out this point of interest   there's the cat the cat is stuck in the bathroom     it looks like it's getting hotter behind me
three     nope     noth- nothing's there bravo   eight romeo one
  oof man down    
cat down rather
as we get out so i think i'm just going to bust down this wall
you extend it to the living room wall
looks like there's   someone asleep perhaps in   the master bedroom     now just let's see if there's
another
yup     yup
there's already fire there  
to try to get through the game room   i'm going to save move
hope this guy is not catching on fire in there another bravo three nothing happening there that's for sure   bravo six romeo one   oh boy    
alright are there any any other points of interest
to help to get this cat out the next time around   i'm the meantime i'm going to  
i think we're there i think we're in it
one thing you can do       which i've
((right))
got it i am checking on   this point of interest in the dining room   looks like it is a false alarm there was no one there
yup  
roll for fire at bravo three romeo four
oh a- alright i'm going to put put out this fire
    yeah
alright one thing you can do     that i found has been useful is you can break down this wall to just bypass all of that if that is something you're interested in doing
that's smoke
((toward))
  put out this fire   and next turn i'm going to break a hole into the master bath check out that point of interest before the other wall     caves in and then any further explosions might
      i'm going to   make my way
((if))
and the so the fire in the kitchen is spreading
one two three four
  oh oh good point
over
yeah i think that was just that- that's five  
hm
east towards the small bathroom
  yeah each so you have to   do two strikes and each strike is two actions yeah
that was like that was like a fire so no one can be in a fire
i don't remember
and i'm going to put out this fire  
lead its way into the master bathroom     so for now i'm going to roll for more fire   at bravo five   romeo three   oh man
to the to the other side of the bed
and i'm going to roll for some more  
  (()) okay yeah
  actually roll for a point of interest
other pillow
  at bravo five romeo four   impossible because the kitchen table's on fire   so i think there might be something going on at bravo five romeo two
  yeah because it was one two three four
that one just wouldn't go out grease fire there   over  
yup there can be a point of interest
  so i think you've you can't do it this turn i think that's one to the door
wait!
you're over there green fireman  
  no worries  
it's alright ((it happens)) to us all
and then two w- so you're left with one more
which you can bank for next time around
there's something else happening in the master   bathroom that we should check up on   i'm going to roll for fire now for bravo three   romeo six   and it looks like it's getting smoky here in the dining room over  
  guess it's +assumed you have a gas mask  
yup over
yup
yup y-
  what's that green fire fighter can't hear you
  copy that and cat i'm going try to get this cat out of here and make my way towards the living room  
  yeah   alright
oh boy  
    so the fire looks like it started off in the living room spread to the kitchen and it's getting even worse in the living room
  good good call  
    at at this point i think the living room in terms of fire is the bigger concern    
you have to be on the space
  copy that alright i'm going on the other side see if we can flank this here fire   ooh   i'm going to put out this fire
got bravo
  no problem     is that it that's going on your end
    there's some more going on in the dining room it's that's probably the next thing we have to worry about     we've got
oh bravo two romeo one got you
so i would a- advise either that or going towards either of our points of interest    
here in the living room     rolling for another point of interest   at bravo seven   romeo four oh boy they're right right next to you
three walls down in the living room so we're going to have to fix that to maintain structural integrity  
is that is that all that's going on in your end
copy that alright i am
copy that alright i'm going to   two points to break down this wall
taking this person out of the living room so that- one more person saved   and i'm going back in for the other
  at  
  yup so yeah so when you say over it's (()) right now so now i'm going to open this door here   going to put out this fire in the kitchen   i'm going
  going in checking this point of interest is somebody in there there's the cat i confirmed there is a cat in the master bathroom   but i'm probably
alright so
bravo three romeo t-  
finishing knocking down this wall on the other side of the house
yeah
  and now   rolling for new point of interest   at bravo s-
  and     rolling for fire now   bravo three
so we have an explosion
oh no
taking the cat
with me
are you-
that is that is smoke in the     alright that is the safest place it could be   okay     you are in the middle of some ~p ~o ~is i'm going to try to again   extinguish some of the fire in the kitchen
  i'm afraid i cannot hear you so
  alright
oh gosh
alright   is that over for you
  hopefully prevent some things from spreading out of control    
alright so i'm going to      
and so i've taken care of one area that was completely on fire   and maybe       what do you think red should i head in this general direction putting out some fire
maybe
put that down to   i'm going to extinguish some of the fire that's in the corner of the master bedroom hopefully that won't spread too much and i'm also going to see what i've got beside me it's a person      
okay   so then i will   take out maybe
and
it looks like i'm pretty far from an exit to the outdoors and i'm a little bit ner- *ouch actually i'm   there's a   there's a door that leads from the game room outside   so i'm going to   so there's one two   three four i'm going to extinguish some fire to try clear a path     to take this person that
this i guess maybe this one is in the longest line of of of destruction so   and take out that guy     alright let's see what's happening   i got bravo seven romeo four   bravo seven romeo four okay now there is fire   completely in the game room   game room is
oh no
alright we got fire fire   fire fire damage to this wall   *yowza
just came underneath me   over
i you had just the fire just spread to this point right so maybe not maybe not damaged (()) but but it could be that this is has more damage
all on fire     and that is all i've got time for over
  and it is full-on hole
sure it's like   alright  
  *yowch alright i'm going to run this doggie to safety
yeah so this fire at the entrance to the dining room   is a little concerning   i'm kind of worried about this point of interest over here in the small bathroom do you think that that's just a lost cause like we should just   choose our fires and and and let that person
how nice
      yeah   th- that's about all i can do i'm afraid    
alright
  great  
i'm going to carry this person
a heavy dog i guess bravo seven romeo three is where we got to look for fire next    
w- would you alright would you find out where that is i'm going to carry this person out to safety  
okay now that that smoldering stuff in the small bathroom is now fire   okay cool    
oh yes please   i
  you can go for it
alright  
okay sure
cool deal so i i'll try to get this fire down to some smoke   and
  we got bravo two romeo five
  after you
  we have one two so maybe we   great and meanwhile i will make my way over to the game room t-   bravo two romeo  
bravo two nope we got bravo five romeo five five and five yes there's a ~p ~o ~i   in the corner of the living room where that smoldering fern is
enter and then    
alright we got here in the master bedroom   between smoke and fire   alright   my my time is over
i guess
alright   so i'm going to go for   one two
yeah that person is probably going to be safe for awhile so i'm going to   head over closer to the the kids' bedroom   and   let's see it's o- one
and actually there's another ~p ~o ~i     it's i'll say over   i'll find out where this ~p ~o ~i is bravo six romeo six there's another ~p ~o ~i in the kids' bedroom  
master bedroom
maybe three four
  kitchen is just got a couple smoldering bits and one fire in the corner the fire in the corner is a bit troubling because   it's part of a large patch of fire that extends into the living room through the open door     but otherwise the kitchen looks like it's in better shape   not as likely to explode and ruin the house   we got fire though spreading through to bravo one romeo six     *woo fire in the corner of the dining room behind you   over
oh no the fire spread in the kitchen i'm sorry   fire spread in the kitchen     causing a bit of a blowout knocking some doors open and causing some damage
two three fo- yeah   and so now let's see where the fire is going we got bravo eight
romeo two
ro- romeo two   that's in the looks like the master bedroom
  (( ))
  it is ^valentine's day so they
yeah
cool oh wait do we put the    
alright
i'm going to reenter the house at the master bedroom   and
we made this s- smoke so actually maybe now it could just be gone
      it's rigged  
right okay cool cool cool
find out what this ~p ~o ~i is it's a cat   so it's one two three four     that is m- that is all for me over
okay
alright
alright so i think that about does it for me so over
  i did
alright i've got the cat one two i'm right by the exit there's some fire beside me in the master bedroom over  
yeah and next to it also i think that i- smoke has become fire  
this guy has become fire
  ((in)) the corner of the dining room here there's a nice fern  
oh wait
i think i think that becomes fire that becomes fire but i don't think we need to maybe
  i'll find where a new ~p ~o ~i is we got bravo five romeo five
  alright so   i'm going to proceed over to this hole that's been knocked into the kitchen wall    
from what i understand alright
right where that person   okay
cool   and then i think we have two points of interest on the board
alright
and then maybe take care of some of this fire that was in the game room   and
  okay   cat is now in safety and i'm going to try to come into the house   maybe there's a new   ~p ~o ~i at bravo three romeo three
great   i'm going to come in   and i'll be ending up next to this guy
let's see here i i like how you are positioned in a good spot to get those people out of there   that dog i think wasn't or the kitty cat wasn't replaced and so we're going to go bravo five romeo six   and see if there's another ~p ~o ~i here it looks like in the corner of the dining room next to the   smoldering business   alright   but the fire however has a mind of its o-
great
i'm going to
yeah
so nope there's not   maybe *braveo bravo six   romeo five
bravo three romeo six alright   i got it  
((looks)) like there's fire in the living room  
cool deal   that's i- i'm over now actually it's i think i think it's your turn
there's another point of interest if you can imagine   in the kids' bedroom there's a-
-m
small bathroom
      i'm at the exit to the from the master bedroom
  bravo three romeo two
i've saved a v- i've got one more victim
no that that's that's too intense
safe   i'm going to enter
and i'll get out next as soon as i can      
into the
and in the meantime
romeo five bravo six
master bedroom  
i'm going to stand i'm standing next to the door from the master bedroom into the master bath   i'll be able to find out one of the points of interest  
at   romeo one
  no
bravo eight
romeo six
we've got a it's gone from smoke to fire now
in a in a short little while here   let's find out if there's another
bravo eight
that is
  there in the master bedroom   but i'm heading fo- i'm going to be heading out the door     let me suggest that maybe the next thing for you to do to get to the   kitchen as quick as possible
possible victim  
in the small bathroom the far corner of the house from where i'm sitting  
romeo three
bravo five
we'll have to look into that we have a couple of victims i- possible victims in that part of the house
  we have a possible point of interest in the f- kitchen it's a good thing that all the fire's been put out there that was   really great work th- that you did before there clearing that out
maybe break through the wall from the master bedroom
we but there's an opening from the outside   so getting in there should be pretty easy
  to get as close as you can as quick as possible to the point of interest there
  thank you     i'm going to look toward the master bath
  over
over
the   going to have to spend some time opening the door
alright   ((f-)) yeah and let's check if there's another condition coming up
  but i can get into the master bath i'll be able to find out   whether we've got a victim here pretty soon
d- do i take this one
  romeo five bravo three
oh
that's too bad
  but we've got to watch out for romeo six bravo four
smoke
some more smoke in the dining room
oh wait
  next to the table
need to roll again   for yeah
  (())
that's still manageable but   but we have a lot of people to g- to work on still   so we better focus on the
so that's   smoke ccoming out of the piano   you're in that room so be careful over
possible victims over
ooh that's a bad spot
  okay i'm going to try coming at the  
kids' bedroom from the dining room
  so i'm going to enter from the outside put out some smoke  
and
  i think i can s- sort of  
diminish the fire that's   between me and the kids' bedroom   but there's still smoke there
i should be able to find out what we've got in that room   pretty soon
  i think you can actually get into the bath
there could be things getting worse
yeah
at romeo two
bravo three   in fact we've have an ex- another explosion in the living room
    the exterior wall is completely blown out we've got fire spreading   to the master bath
great thanks okay ((i)) can find out what we've got here
it's a dog
and  
  i'm going to get this dog away from the w- wall that's just been damaged
  the whole north end of the
okay i'm going to move i'm getting my victim out of the   master bedroom
of the living room is is in flames   with most of the walls blown out
based on the acti- the explosion from the living room
so i'm moving back toward the door into the master bedroom   i should be able to get out of here ((then))
  over
  good okay great   i'm going to get into the master bath with you
  and
  i can get in and help i- with the  
get closer to the outside
  the fire that's in the
  next time
and i'll find out who this point of interest is next to the other door we have a victim
living room
we're going to look at  
  but let me   i think first i'm going to find out what i've got here   in the corner
romeo one bravo five
next to the door that goes into the living room
that's actually right next to where i'm standing right now there's smoke coming up in the master bath
  so i'm going to w- try and get this person out
  we've got a victim in the corner that's only or real close to the door   we need to get some of the fire ou- put out in this room so that it's a little easier there's been a lot of   wall damage
    as soon as i can  
i'm going to put that out probably before i try to get out of here
    over
meanwhile we've got a possible situation coming up at  
and   there's a lot of fire going on right now
romeo five bravo four
  i think that since this is the last
so the  
point of interest i better roll for another
to see what's going on
the dining room is getting worse there's smoke throughout there's   fire in three s- positions
maybe at     romeo three
bravo two
  but   there +don't seem to be any possible victims there at the moment  
n-   that's right under your feet
did you s-
oh great thank you i've got
((he)) came out   alright
    romeo six or romeo five and bravo three so it's romeo five bravo three so there is more smoke in the dining room  
okay so you want me to just start playing okay   i will go first then  
so i've used two points to remove   the dude from there
((no it)) yeah here

enter the house i'm going to create  
and i'll keep on working on removing   folks from the dining room and hopefully i can
and another point to   to extinguish the smoke
yeah   it's the dining room by the kitchen ta- or the dining room table
a hole in the wall through the small bathroom

alright so
that doesn't cost anything so we have one
okay so we made
nope
    little progress on on that front but i will continue moving the house to extinguish flames and working towards
yeah right
alright i am going to use
two
  two points to get through the hole that i've created in the master bathroom
okay so that's all of them so i do have a person of interest here  
  points of interest   that is   almost my turn i'm going to roll for fire again i've got
oops one oh awesome that's wonderful thank you  
i will roll for another person of interest and then on my next turn

    i have to roll f- also for a point of interest so seven
  i've got bravo eight  
and then two to check out my point of interest we have another bunch of nothing on the toilet in the master bathroom  
  bravo seven and
  okay good in that case then i will   i will just stay there that is my turn over  
  romeo three
which ((i)) suppose is  
      ((how am i))
fine
alright
((side of)) you from   the living room it might be moving back toward toward the kitchen
  alright so i will go ahead and backtrack through the door or through the doorway that we kind of demolished with my person   i believe with
  over
  alright
i've made it to the game room i don't see anything more of interest here but i will go ahead and and see what else is going on fire-wise
  this girl i can go
  just  
one space with with what i've got left  
we've got bravo three romeo three
mm hm hm
  *jeez
okay i think that might have happened once but i wasn't sure
  alright
  so we've already got fire here so i believe we're going to have to add fire again correct me if i'm wrong ^john
  alright you- you're very generous   alright   i believe
((it is)) time to to roll to see where else we're doing with but the small bathroom seems to be contained for right now  
i   yeah my my apologies there alright back to you
alright so long as we've got that wall up in the living room and dining room i'm going to see if i can  
alright i may be a little slow on the trigger but feel free to jump in and   help me help you help us  
  now do i need to expend any energy to find out what both these are
  we've got   bravo three and romeo one
  ((or one))
    i believe we're dealing with more explosions so i think we're just are we opening the door or okay  
  okay  
okay
((well)) i can technically start anywhere right
  alright we do have another person in the dining room
okay
and   we'll go ahead and demolish this wall for a another point of entry if needed
    since i'm right here i do want to double check and see what else we've got if we have any false alarms here or if we can just focus on saving this person  
yeah if this is a door here by  
just one
  bravo six and yeah
okay
okay     i don't normally see doors in master bedrooms but i will take advantage  
and
  and we do have a false alarm in the dining room so we just have one person     in the dining room     adjacent to the wall   between us and the kitchen and living room and now master bath fires
wow  
then we would we also extend it this way or just kind of stop there   in the living room
okay this never ends
    i think my best bet is still to try to get into the kitchen i don't see a point of entry    
  so there is some smoke that i think may be worth taking care of while i'm here       i will
okay then i think we've got     fire taken care of in
yeah i don't see a way to get into the   bathroom or kids' bedroom from this other angle so i'm going to head that direction
  do
mm  
a couple
  alright
movements here and i believe i still can get away with at least
all four directions    
maybe extinguishing   here and moving on top of this guy for future refer- this smoke for future reference  
i think it's back to you ^john over
  you want me to go and roll for those right now
^john i didn't i wasn't able to hear you on that    
okay
  we've got bravo two and romeo four
would that be   for two
  okay s-
okay
  alright i think i'd like to go ahead and move toward the small bathroom figure out   our point of interest and the smoke we see there
okay    
over here
  okay so i just kind of stayed where i was   alright sorry i might have been following the video too much or misinterpreting the video  
  bravo one romeo four
  *jeez okay well since   since i've got my   person with me i am going to move forward toward   getting them to safety i believe   i might be able to head right out to the ambulance area is that correct   okay well i will leave them with   our ~e ~m ~ts and    
i'm sorry   i ha- don't have a death wish against anyone  
  i they were all impressed that you can't really stand on fire but you can stand on smoke   it looks cool   okay    
  okay
would we
would we be doing that mm would we be   putting the  
    bravo five romeo two  
breaking the wall down like that
  alright and i can hang onto
over
looks like we've got fire spreading in the master bath by the door and a   person of interest still   in the corner
  would we be   breaking the wall down like this   over okay
  one point i believe
  move back   looks like  
we've got bravo two and romeo one
  dare i open the door of the kitchen or     focus on the kids' bedroom  
  on this same turn can i see our our point of interest or   do we need to wait wait a little further
  okay so there's not already a fire here oh
  thank you over  
yeah bravo two r- yeah yeah yeah
got you over thank you
  so we've got further fire in the living room
  i didn't catch you ^john
  alright let's see where where we're where also we're doing with
  alright all the points of interest are more toward   that half of the house so i will go ahead and try and maybe move through the kitchen with you and  
  yes over
  is this back to you then ^john over
