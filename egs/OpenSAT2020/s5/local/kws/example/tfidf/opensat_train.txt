-- %er %um 
okay i think i'm going to 
okay %um i'll go first this time 
try to make my way into the kitchen first and start putting out the fire in there to avoid explosions %um and maybe you can focus on 
%um 
i think i'm going to 
just break through the small bathroom wall and try to get to this 
rescuing victims first %um 
%uh victim in here first 
so i'm going to use like my whole turn and make a hole in the outside wall so we have a way to get in and out 
i don't know what the fastest way in there is i guess through this door %um which is in the living room so i'll use one to come in from the living room 
%um rolling for fire 
bravo two romeo four 
two to put out this fire 
and my last point to move closer to the kitchen door 
so that's 
fire 
%uh the fire is spreading to bravo two romeo four 
because it's next to fire 
so 
maybe you could concentrate on putting out the fire in there <background> 
bravo two romeo four 
so there's some smoke right by me in the living room 
over <background> 
i think you can <background> 
move in here <background> 
okay i'm in the living room i'm going to use one action to open up the door into the kitchen 
okay i'm going to go into the small bathroom 
two to put out the fire 
and check on this point of interest it's a woman 
and my last point to step into the kitchen 
i'll work on putting out the rest of that fire on my next turn 
so 
i'm going to bank my last point and get her out on the next turn 
fire's spreading to bravo two romeo two 
bravo four 
romeo one 
so there is an explosion in the living room 
so there's more smoke with that victim in the master bath %um 
%uh so the fire spreads 
over 
this way through the living room 
and also this way %um 
copy that 
alright 
%um 
over 
okay i'm going to use two action points to carry this woman out to safety so we saved oue first 
victim %um 
i have three left so 
i think i'm going to %um 
copy that i <background> 
go in this door to the dining room and get to this other point of interest 
so 
got it chief 
one two three and i can check on them on my next turn 
alright i am in the kitchen i'm going to %um 
just do my best to put out some of this fire 
%uh spreading the fire romeo four 
bravo six 
i'm going to put one out completely 
so there's some smoke in the dining room over 
and 
turn these two to smoke 
i'm 
going to check to see where the fire's spreading bravo four romeo three 
that is right where i'm standing in the kitchen so it's a good thing i put out that fire 
lots of smoke in the kitchen now 
over 
%uh we also need another point of interest 
copy that i'm going to 
ooh that's not good 
i think put out the rest of this smoke in the kitchen and head towards the living room which is almost completely on fire now 
okay %um i'm going to check on this point of interest it's a woman 
so 
so 
i'll put out the rest of this smoke 
i'm going start carrying her out 
and move toward the door of the living room 
and i'll bank an action point for the next turn 
fire's spreading to bravo three romeo two 
spreading the fire bravo seven romeo three 
another explosion in the living room 
%uh smoke in the game room over <background> 
so the fire spreads 
even further damages the wall between the living room and the kitchen 
%uh breaks through this wall into the master bath and there's a possible victim in the master bath 
who's now in danger and damaging the outside wall of the living room 
maybe you should break through that wall to get to that %um point of interest in there 
so i i really need to get in there <background> 
okay i'm going to use two action points 
to move this woman one space and another two to get her out of the house so we saved another victim 
%um i still have one extra action point 
so i'm going to 
actually i'm going to save that again so i can break into the kid's bedroom because there is a victim in there with a lot of fire 
%uh looks like we also need another possible victim on the board 
rolling for the spread of fire bravo seven romeo three 
so there's already smoke there that turns to fire in the game room 
%uh rolling for another point of interest 
bravo one romeo four 
alright i'm going to 
so now there's a victim in the living room 
come through into the living room and put out this smoke and put out a fire 
and turn this to smoke also 
%uh one of us needs to get outside and try to get to some of these victims pretty quickly 
bravo five romeo four the fire's spreading some smoke in the kitchen over 
okay i'm going to use two action points to 
%uh finish busting through this wall 
and 
another two to put out this fire so i can move in there on my next turn 
alright i'm going to continue putting out fire in the living room but heading towards the master bath to check on that potential victim 
oh wait i have one more action point i'll move into the kid's bedroom 
%uh i'm going to put out some smoke 
bravo six romeo six 
move here and put out this fire completely 
so 
i'll get in the master bath and check on that ~POI on my next go 
that's where i am 
that's not good so there's fire there which knocks me out sends me to the hospital and that victim is still in danger 
bravo three romeo five <background> 
the fire's spreading 
there's now smoke in the dining room over 
over 
okay %um i'm going to try to get back in that kid's bedroom and check on that point of interest 
so one to move in two put out this fire 
and three to move onto the spot with the victim 
copy that 
i'm going to 
put out one more fire and 
head into the master bath 
bravo six romeo two 
i'll check on this point of interest on my next go 
so there's more smoke in the master bedroom over 
the fire is spreading to bravo eight romeo three 
so there's smoke there 
so now there's fire in the game room right next to a potential victim over 
okay i'm going to check on this point of interest it's a man in the kid's bedroom 
i'm going to turn this fire next to us nex- %uh to smoke 
and i'm going to start moving him out 
i'll get him out on my next turn 
%uh spreading the fire bravo four romeo one 
so that 
smoke turns to fire in the master bath 
copy that 
alright i'm checking on this potential victim we do have a male here in the master bath 
over 
i'm trying to see my quickest way out of here 
i think i'm going to carry him through the master bedroom 
so i'll use 
%uh most of my turn to bring him closer to that door and open up this door 
the fire's spreading to bravo two romeo five 
okay i'm going to get this guy out of here so two points to get him out we saved another victim 
%um so now there's fire 
in the dining room 
and 
i think i'll use my next to points to go back into the house 
%um i think i'm going to go back in the kid's bedroom and put out some of this fire so one 
and two to turn this to smoke 
bravo seven romeo four 
so that's next to fire there's more fire in the game room over <background> 
copy that 
alright i'm moving this male victim out through the master bedroom 
i'll get him out of the house on my next turn 
the fire's still spreading to bravo three romeo four 
%uh so we now have more fire in the kitchen over 
%uh <background> 
copy 
copy that 
alright i'm getting this victim out and taking him to the hospital 
one more victim saved 
%um 
i guess i will go into 
the kid's bedroom 
%um making my way through the dining room to try to put out some of that fire 
okay i'm going to open this door for one point move into the dining room 
so i'll turn this fire to smoke in the dining room 
and i'll roll to see where the next point of interest goes 
and move into this space and check on this point of interest it's a false alarm 
%uh bravo three romeo five so we have a potential victim right next to me in the dining room that was lucky 
so rolling for 
another point of interest bravo eight romeo two 
%um the fire is still spreading to bravo five romeo six 
so there's another possible victim in the master bedroom right next to another one so one of us should probably get over there <background> 
so we have some more smoke in the dining room also with me over <background> 
okay %uh rolling for fire bravo one romeo two 
bravo one romeo two lots of smoke in the living room over <background> 
oh no <background> 
was it a person 
okay i'm going to move into the kitchen there's a victim in there so <background>

so one two to open the door three to move into the kitchen 
and four to move closer to the possible victim 
rolling for fire bravo four romeo five 
so smoke in the dining room over <background> 
alright copy that i'm going to work on putting out 
%uh some of this fire that's erupted in the dining room from that last explosion 
okay i'm going to move and check on this victim there's a woman so that's two points for another two i'm going to move her closer to the door over %uh rolling for fire 
i'll just 
use everything i've got to put out 
some of that and we have more fire spreading to bravo two romeo three 
bravo five romeo two 
so we've got some smoke in the living room over 
another explosion more fire in the master bath damage to the master bath wall <background> 
%um 
over <background> 
i thought that was a point of interest <background> 
alright copy that 
okay i'm going to move this victim out %uh with all four of my action points so we saved another one 
i'm 
going to continue to move toward the kid's bedroom 
and put out some of this smoke in the living room 
rolling for a new point of interest bravo one romeo two 
and open the door between the li- dining room and the kid's bedroom so i can get in there on my next turn 
so in the living room surrounded by a lot of smoke %uh 
the fire's spreading to bravo seven romeo five 
bravo six romeo one for spreading the fire 
an explosion in the kid's bedroom right where i was headed

so we've got the kid's bedroom completely on fire now 
we've got damage to the wall between the game room 
%uh damage to 
the wall between the small bathroom 
and damage to the wall of the dining room 
over 
okay %um i think i'm going to try to get to this victim in the living room and put out some of this fire so 
i'll do one 
two to put this smoke out 
three to go on here and four to check it it's another false flag 
%um rolling for a new point of interest 
bravo five romeo six 
there's 
a potential victim in the dining room right next to some fire 
%uh spreading the fire bravo eight romeo six 
so there's fire %er smoke in the small bathroom over 
copy that chief 
alright i'm going to actually head back just the way i came 
and check on this potential victim in the dining room 
and we have a male victim 
okay i'm going to work on putting out some more of this fire in the living room 
i'm going to use my last action to put out 
i'm going to move on to this smoke 
some of this fire turn it to smoke and try to get this guy out on my next turn 
put this one out completely

so more smoke in the living room 
i'm going to get out this male victim 
get him to the hospital so we've saved another person 
%um that's all i can do for right now 
i think next time i'm going to try to get to this victim in the small bathroom 
so we've got another point of interest at bravo five romeo three 
%um maybe you should come on this side of the house so that you can get to these victims after <background> 
and that's %uh in the kitchen 
not in too much immediate danger 
and we s- %uh fire spreading to bravo three romeo six

alright i'm going to move into the master bath and repair 
two damages 
and turn this to smoke 
copy that 
%uh spreading the fire bravo five romeo three 
alright i'm <background>

another explosion 
this wall here 
more fire 
and put out this fire so i can try to get to that victim quickly %uh the fire's spreading to bravo four romeo two 
and more damage to the wall

i'm going to check on this potential victim we do we have a female victim in the small bathroom 
two three and repair this for four

the living room kitchen and kid's bedroom are all almost completely engulfed in flames with the most structural damage to the kid's bedroom %um there are a couple 
ruptured walls in the kid's bedroom and the living room over

and %um 
extinguish some smoke while i go 
copy i'm heading in to the game room 
%uh checking out this ~POI there's a cat here %um 
%uh if you could carry them out that would be great 
i can't 
get us out yet 
i'm going to try and extinguish some of these flames although 
and at bravo five romeo six 
there's been another explosion in the children's bedroom so that exterior wall is completely destroyed %uh 
the master bathroom 
door is open 
and the wall of 
the kid's b- other walls are damaged also 
okay <background> 
alright i am moving towards the door and i am safely outside with the ~POI 
i 
see something at bravo three romeo three i'm sorry that's incorrect bravo two romeo two 
actually at bravo eight romeo two 
there might be a ~POI in the master bedroom it's pretty smoky in there right now 
i'm seeing at bravo five romeo six %uh there is some smoke where you are right now 
copy 
over 
copy alright i am taking 
this cat outside 
i might see a new ~POI at bravo one romeo three 
%uh in the dining room right by the door 
%uh i will check that out next 
(()) 
copy i'm going to enter through the kid's bedroom %um 
i think we're just rolling for a ~POI <background> 
through the wall open this door to the small bathroom and make my way towards a potential ~POI 
i can't tell what it is yet %um in bravo 
c- <background> 
eight romeo four 
there is some smoke now by the door of the game room 
copy 
entering the dining room checking out this ~POI there is a person here and 
i can bring them outside now 
i'm seeing a new ~POI at bravo eight romeo six 
%uh actually at bravo one romeo four 
~POI pretty close to the dining room 
(()) 
copy sure copy 
copy i have a dog with me in the small bathroom %um 
alright i am heading back into the dining room 
we can't make it out yet but working towards that %um 
that kid's bedroom entrance over 
there is a person here 
can't do anything about that yet %uh but i am going to put out this smoke here by the entrance over 
%uh at 
bravo seven romeo two 
oh no 
%uh 
been some fire 
has broken out in the master bedroom where you are 
you're under <background> 
copy i am moving with the ~POI out of the dining room and we are safely outside %uh 
a new ~POI at bravo three romeo two 
in the living room as well 
yes <background> 
over 
copy %uh 
i think 
my next move is going to be 
heading 
to check out the ~POIS in the dining room and master bath 
does that sound okay red 
okay heading there now to the dining room <background> 
%uh and we'll continue that in a moment over 
if the door's open 
copy %uh there is a person here in the living room 
i can't carry them out yet 
okay i am 
heading outside with the dog and we are safely outside 
but %um 
i can't get back inside yet but 
sh- i'm going to 
i do see another 
point of interest potentially at bravo two romeo four 
start breaking down the this wall here 
and i will save one of my moves for next time over 
in the living room 
and at bravo two romeo six there is some more smoke here in the dining room over 
copy %uh i'm going to bring this person outside <background> 
they're safely outside now i see a new ~POI at bravo four romeo five 
in the hallway 
potential new ~POI i'm going to head back in and and finish %uh getting that person out of the master bath 
copy %uh heading back in 
two and 
%uh 
copy %uh i'm deciding whether or not to break down this wall 
breaking down the wall i believe if we use one more the house will fall down is that correct 
so i can get to those ~POIS without 
%um 
heading into the master bath 
extinguishing the flame 
and seeing who's here there is a person here over 
what do you think red fire +fi- fighter 
red <background> 
copy <background> 
alright i am extinguishing <background> 
or i am 
quelling some of these flames to smoke or 
and heading towards the ~POI 
copy i am heading with ~POI out of the bathroom <background> 
the kitchen is completely engulfed in flames %uh with severe wall damage 
into the living room can't make it out yet 
%uh the living room and kid's bedroom are both %um heavily engulfed in flames %uh there 
%um 
over 
is exterior wall damage in the kid's bedroom and the living room over 
copy bringing this ~POI outside through the living room 
i'm checking on there is a person here in the living room over 
%um i think there might be somebody else inside at bravo eight romeo four 
%uh that is right by the hole that we created in the game room 
+okay i 
am going to head towards the door with this ~POI 
and we are safely outside 
do you see another potential point ~POI at bravo eight romeo two 
copy i'm heading in through the game room to check on this ~POI there is a dog here <background> 
in the master bedroom 
and i'm bringing the dog outside 
over 
copy i am entering through the living room 
through some smoke 
and see that there is a person here %uh we can't make it out yet 
%uh 
i'm just going to take out 
ch- are we missing a ~POI 
some of this smoke here over 
yeah 
i think i might see something at bravo seven romeo four 
in the game room 
%um 
let's see i will 
copy 
head in there 
heading towards the door with the ~P- <background> 
and check it out 
with the ~POI <background> 
there is a person here 
%um and we can't make it 
can't do anything about it right now 
yet but soon over <background> 
%um 
no walls that i can repair 
i'm going to put out this smoke here <background> 
is this still your turn 
(()) 
copy 
heading 
copy <background> 
i am heading outside with the first ~POI 
out of the house 
with this ~POI we are safely outside 
and i 
i see there might be something at bravo five romeo one 
am going to start 
breaking down the walls to the small bathroom %um 
%um in the small bathroom there is some smoke there as well over 
to get to that second potential ~POI 
%um 
okay i 
%uh forgot to mention that there might be an additional ~POI at bravo eight romeo two 
in the master bedroom 
copy that <background> 
i'm going to %um 
%um let's see 
i'm trying to figure out the best way 
break down 
this wall to the small bathroom 
to get to the two ~POIS 
head inside and check out %uh 
%um on the master bedroom side of the house 
this ~POI there was a person here so %uh we can't make out make it out now but 
%uh 
when we next can we will head outside over 
am 
going to 
i guess enter through the game room again 
(()) i'm 
walking through the game room 
and i'm in the master bedroom now but can't check out those ~POIS yet 
and at 
bravo five romeo six 
i'm heading outside with this 
there is now more fire in the kid's bedroom 
~POI 
and i'm heading in through the dining room 
checking 
%uh 
it out there is a person here %uh we can't get out yet b- %uh i see an additional 
~POI at bravo three romeo two 
%uh that's incorrect actually bravo two romeo three 
additional potential ~POI in the living room over 
copy <background> 
alright i am %uh checking out this potential ~POI 
by the shelf here there is a person here 
%uh 
i'm going to 
(()) 
start bringing them outside just trying to figure out what the closest exit is and i think it is the game room so 
heading back 
towards the hallway 
at 
bravo six romeo five 
there has been an explosion in the kid's bedroom so 
copy i am bringing this ~POI outside we are now safely outside 
%uh i am going to 
%um 
we have wall damage 
reenter the building 
(()) 
in the living room head through some smoke to check out 
and fire in the kid's bedroom 
%uh 
a ~POI but it is actually a false alarm 
(()) 
i am seeing at bravo four romeo four romeo five there's been an explosion in the dining room 
(()) 
%uh there's been wall damage 
and %um 
sick 
sick fire and smoke in here 
over 
%uh there is a point of interest at bravo eight romeo one 
%uh right by where you are in the master bedroom there might be something else there over <background> 
copy 
%uh 
i think i since there's no fire immediately around us right now i am just going to go back to the master bathroom 
and check out 
there's a person there and it was a false alarm so i'm heading 
back towards the ~POI and %um 
we can't get outside yet 
%um 
i 
copy %uh 
am seeing that at 
i 
bravo three romeo one 
am trying to figure out how to best check out these ~POIS 
there is now more fire in the living room 
%um i'm going to head in 
to the master bedroom where there are no flames 
(()) 
to check out this potential ~POI there is a person here %um we cannot make it out yet but i'm going to go ahead and put out some of this smoke that's here over 
%uh 
oh yes there 
it in bravo one romeo six 
it's a new ~POI at bravo one romeo five 
there 
is more smoke in the dining room over 
bravo one romeo five that's actually incorrect it's at bravo one romeo two 
%uh also incorrect bravo seven romeo four 
a new ~POI in the game room 
copy i'm heading towards the door 
%uh with this person we cannot make it out yet but soon 
%um at 
bravo three romeo two 
%uh 
there has been an explosion in the living room 
so 
%uh flames are spreading rapidly 
%uh around the 
~POI 
in the dining room over <background> 
copy <background> 
heading out now 
%uh to the hallway 
and we are now %uh by you in the game room heading outside 
bravo two romeo one 
%uh there has been an explosion in the living room 
oh <background> 
so we have some damage to 
%um 
the walls in the living room 
is there is there any other ~POIS in the building <background> 
as well as to the small bathroom 
and that 
half wall in the dining room 
copy <background> 
%uh i am heading outside 
i've carried this person safely outside i'm going to 
copy 
%uh 
reenter the building would you like some back up in the dining room 
copy alright heading out right now <background> 
red 
can do you copy 
%uh we are outside 
%uh yup over 
there is a new point of interest <background> 
(()) 
%uh we need some points of interest on the table 
%uh red i %uh i'll 
alright %um 
i think it's your go go ahead <background> 
how about we just 
points of interest in the small bathroom 
%uh lay in them in there 
dining room and master bath 
alright %um 
i am going to enter the master bedroom 
it looks like a pretty standard situation here we got fire in the kitchen living room and the kid's bedroom 
and %uh 
make my way 
to check on the first %uh point of interest here in the master bath 
i'm going to enter the master bedroom 
and check on this point of interest which is a false flag %um that's my turn %um 
i do see the fire spreading at romeo five bravo seven 
well that's a great start you got a explosion 
roll for fire spreading 
to begin the game 
bravo three 
(()) 
romeo five it looks like this smoke turned to fire 
we have damage to the walls 
around that spot and the entire kid's bedroom is filled up that's %uh that %uh point of interest in the small bathroom is going to be hard to get to over 
and we have a couple smokes turning into fire now in the dining room over 
%um 
alright 
i think this time i'm going to focus on fires first and 
~POIS can come 
come out as soon as it's a safe exit instead of putting holes through the walls and all of that 
(()) 
i need i needed a luck change here two 
(()) 
to get rid of the fire there 
and turn some to smoke 
in the living room and the one couch is looking 
(()) 
slightly better just smoky 
romeo five bravo seven 
okay %um 
and say no more we got an explosion to start it out 
able to check here in the master bath b- b- it's a false flag 
kid's bedroom is back <background> 
to the full fire 
%um 
i'll likely continue 
damage counters 
into the living room to work on the fire in there 
along the walls 
over <background> 
%um 
a great way to start 
point of interest is showing up at bravo two romeo s- or sorry romeo two bravo seven 
(()) 
%um so back in the master bedroom 
alright %um <background> 
and fire is spreading at romeo five bravo four 
alright i am 
so 
i don't have exactly much to do here in the master bedroom and master bath so i'm going to get back out 
more smoke filling up the dining room over 
three four and step into the living room so i can check on the fire that's spreading and the point of interest %uh 
alright <background> 
%um 
fire is spreading at bravo eight 
tough decision for me but i think the kitchen 
romeo six so some smoke is now in the small bathroom over 
should be a priority one two three four 
actually you know what not getting to that fire turning it to smoke for now 
alright %um i'll just get rid of that smoke keep the master bath clear two three four 
have them set up for next time 
for me to take out 
%um 
%uh romeo three 
living room fire is starting to die down 
bravo seven 
however at romeo four 
smoke in the game room always a little bit of smoke in there i feel over 
bravo seven 
the kitchen is not looking as good now over 
yeah you were fine 
i got some fire contained here in the living room 
alright i'm on that %uh <background> 
%uh two three points used now turning that fire into smoke 
i'm removing some of the fire 
to my right that's outside the dining room door 
i'm hopefully going to get rid of that completely next turn 
i will see the fire now spreading 
%uh it was one two three four i think that's all i could do that was a quick turn 
bravo six romeo six 
it's looking there's an explosion in the kid's bedroom 
%uh wish i had 
so you got 
fire spreading to the one side blowing up the door 
more going on romeo three bravo two 
on the other one 
some smoke right in the living room now outside the kitchen over 
and then 
some damage on the on the exterior and the wall between the kitchen 
%um 
alright yeah i'm wondering if for you getting out of the small bathroom chopping a hole in the wall's easiest way out and it's a long yeah a long exit otherwise %um <background> 
over 
alright i'm going to continue 
woo <background> 
to 
douse the fire in the living room i'm going to sa- no not save a point and %um 
check out where it's spreading romeo two bravo one right in front of me some more bl- smoke's +moving up 
alright 
containing some more fire in the kitchen 
getting a little smoke around me 
ooh that's where i rolled last yeah 
and %uh i should probably head back into the master bed- bedroom afterwards over 
%uh just the one fire 
explosion 
in the corner of the kitchen by the game room door 
oh <background> 
%um hope it stays that way for a little while romeo four bravo four %ah wow smoke right where i'm standing at good thing i cleared out the fire next to me 
because i would have been in the hospital 
%uh over and out 
(()) 
(()) 
oh <background> 
alright seen that point of interest pop up with some smoke so i'm just going to get rid of that right away %um 
true <background> 
on the other side of me as well there's still some smoke %uh 
alright %um 
i'm going to move here and then convert that fire to smoke 
actually i'm going to have to step into this kitchen and make sure there's no 
so the living room's looking a little bit better now 
huge explosions %uh 
%um 
however 
going to work on that 
fire is spreading at romeo eight 
instead of the master bedroom point of interest but romeo three bravo one some more smoke now in the living room 
or sorry bravo eight 
romeo three 
%um some game room 
%uh smoke is popping up now over <background> 
%uh not not the worst though over 
oh wow <background> 
that's wild <background> 
alright that's manageable %uh 
going to be a point of interest 
i think 
i guess we could do that <background> 
i'm going to have t- i'm i need t- i need to get rid of this fire in the kitchen 
yeah 
not sure if that's any better <background> 
it's been taunting me 
and then here too <background> 
two three %uh adding to smoke you know what 
yeah 
alright %um since we got <background> 
fully clear kitchen at the moment 
time limit here i'm going to check on 
looking like the living room's still there 
point of interest in the living room i have %uh i have a woman in the corner of the living room 
and %uh romeo one bravo eight smoke in the master bedroom again 
i'm going to save a point for next turn 
alright i'm going to step into the kitchen 
%uh that's it that's out over and out for me <background> 
get rid of the smoke or get rid of the fire and the smoke where i'm standing 
and find out romeo three 
(()) 
bravo seven 
and hopefully next turn i can actually 
now we have some more smoke in the game room that's starting to fill up over 
%uh get that point of interest out of the danger of the fire 
%uh alright fire is spreading at romeo five bravo one 
unfortunate that smoke's turning to fire but 
%uh it was a false flag that we lost anyway so 
another point of interest at romeo six 
bravo five 
by the way i can't hear you okay got it got it <background> 
also in the dining room over 
alright i'm going to take my whole turn to move this point of interest towards the exit 
rolling for fire spreading now at romeo six bravo seven 
alright there's an explosion here 
(()) 
alright 
unfortunately that's there there but you should be able to save over 
one 
two three four i'm going to get to that person 
actually find out if it's a person next turn i mean 
romeo four bravo three is 
(()) 
kitchen is still filling up with fire now 
ar- are you good there red fire fighter over got you %um <background> 
%uh that's it for me over 
one two three i'm going to 
over 
deal with some of this stuff going on in the living room 
while i have the ability to get through the kitchen as easily 
as i can 
and rolling at romeo one bravo one fire in the living room 
acu- accumulating over 
%uh explosion okay 
o- okay 
checking this point of interest we do have a person here i'm going to get rid of the fire 
over alright %um i'm just going to get this person out of here too 
and 
turning in some more fire into smoke right right by me 
that's for two 
so hopefully we're not taking out 
%um 
alright <background> 
i had a point banked from the last turn 
romeo two bravo one 
just where i'm headed 
so i'm going to move back in 
i'll get rid of that smoke 
%uh 
the smoke is now looking to be fire in the living room over 
and get rid of this fire 
it's one two three four 
and 
move over closer to here 
points taken but sorry that was one two three 
i'm going to roll for a point of interest now at romeo three 
bravo eight 
%uh 
%uh so 
right in front of this fire 
a point of interest right here 
and fire is spreading at romeo one 
in the corner of the living room by the couch is but a romeo four bravo four 
bravo seven so there's some smoke in the master bedroom 
smoke filling back up in the kitchen 
could just be some leftovers from that fire that was just there %uh over and out <background> 
oh yeah it yeah it goes in all <background> 
directions 
alright i'm going to try to make my way directly out through the game room with this point of interest %uh <background> 
one move i'm going to use the other two points for that turn 
to get rid of the smoke and %uh 
open that door 
alright 
romeo one 
bravo two 
the living room's almost completely engulfed now over 
alright 
can you repeat that chief <background> 
three minutes alright <background> 
i'm going to take down the fires down to my %uh 
alright i'm able to step into the game room but not get them out yet 
to my right 
%uh that'll be my next move 
and right ahead of me 
in the living room 
%uh 
%uh that's the only spot of fire left in the house 
after that i got to get into that living room hopefully there's not an explosion ri- in here now 
is in the corner of the living room 
we do have a lot of smoke 
romeo one bravo six 
and that could set things up 
is some more smoke in the master bedroom so we avoided that explosion for now over 
%uh pretty poorly coming out 
romeo two 
bravo seven 
and just like that 
the master bedroom is almost completely full of smoke over 
no you if you had an explosion you still got some here and this door 
so that blew the door open and the damage counter here <background> 
alright i'm getting that person out 
over alright <background> 
so we did sa- 
%um i'm going to start dealing with this kitchen fire 
save somebody here %um <background> 
one two three 
now got two more 
%uh i'm checking four for this we we do have another person in the living room i can work on but for the moment i think i'm going to keep working on this kitchen if you want to come in from the other side %uh 
moves i'm just going to %uh 
get rid of that smoke or the fire by the entrance so it's easier for us to move in there 
alright %uh i think it's time to pay some attention to the master suite i'm going to get this door open 
%uh 
i'm going to roll for a point of interest at romeo three bravo 
we got romeo five bravo three 
three so 
and step in to see if anything's going on with this %uh ~POI 
is some smoke 
not in the best location but 
right in the dining room 
we can get to them and then fire is at romeo six bravo four so 
over 
in the master bath i'm hoping then to deal with the smoke in the master bed 
right behind you there's some more smoke but you look okay for right now over 
hopefully 
it stays that way 
%uh romeo six bravo eight 
the small bathroom has a little bit of smoke in it 
over <background> 
alright i'm going in one two three <background> 
i'm going to close this door 
for now in case there's an explosion %uh 
alright making my way into the living room one two three 
alright you got a ~POI confirmed 
romeo six 
in the master bath 
bravo four 
and four 
going to get them towards the the exit via master bedroom 
some smoke and it's turning into fire 
i'm going to turn that to smoke 
%uh now in the dining room over 
%uh 
alright 
fire romeo one bravo seven ooh 
romeo five bravo four this smoke is turning to fire but it's not converting anything else into fire so that's that's enough for now over 
alright going to be a little bit harder we got a fire that's turning all to smoke 
into fires now in the master bed i'm going to have to take more time getting this victim out but 
i think it's still possible over <background> 
alright %um 
i know <background> 
going to step to where we have this point of interest 
pick them up and get them closer to the exit next turn i should be able to get them out extinguish some fire while i can 
%um romeo five bravo one 
woof 
(()) 
we have some smoke also turning into fire in the dining room starting to look a little bit worse 
%um i can get to that after getting this person out over <background> 
literally just in an (()) like 
every spot around it gets something if it can 
oh but you already put one there 
i don't want look at your ((dice))  i think this is one that spread there so there's one here h- and put one here <background> 
oof <background> 
great 
wow <background> 
it's a hot seat %um doors open 
alright %um 
fire to the master bedroom is put out 
going to step one two three <background> 
%um going to move this victim out so we've saved another one 
going to be in the kitchen next to the point of interest if we can check 
i 
%uh 
going to bank a point 
that's all i can do for this turn but 
but romeo five bravo eight 
for next turn 
at romeo two 
%uh it's like really can't do anything while i got a victim here %um 
seeing more smoke in the small bathroom over 
bravo four 
it's like master bath has a little bit of smoke in it now over 
romeo one bravo eight oh 
(()) 
man just what i didn't want to see an explosion 
in the master bedroom just when the house was looking alright two explosions back to back %uh right in front of you but hopefully it looks like you're poised to help anyway over red 
alright i'm moving into the dining room 
see if we have somebody and we don't it's another false flag in the kitchen %um i can still work on 
you're going to just the nearest 
smoke and fire out of there %um 
putting out smoke and fire there so that's no big deal 
there's still some in the corner which i can get to 
%uh you need to roll for 
romeo five bravo one 
well there's an explosion 
two points of two points of interest okay romeo four 
%uh luckily none of us are in the way there 
bravo t- %uh romeo four bravo four 
but we got some damage to the exterior wall damage between the living room and the dining room wall 
alright i'm going to step into the master bedroom with you 
actually right back 
and %uh going to get rid of the fire right 
%um over 
in the kitchen we have another point of interest and i i think i need one more right alright romeo five bravo eight <background> 
%uh right by me 
because i know by next turn i'll be able to get out fully 
so right in the small bathroom by that hole we chopped 
%uh romeo six bravo five alright fire has broken out now in the dining room on the piano corner 
also by a lot of smoke so <background> 
rolling for fire now romeo one bravo four 
%uh by the ~POI there's two in there though so i think 
smoke right where you're at and hopefully you can get out of there soon over 
i think we'll probably concentrate over there after over 
i i got it <background> 
that's not a door <background> 
three minutes to get two people alright %um 
unfortunately <background> 
i guess i i forgot to roll for another point of interest the last turn i'm going to do that right now just to make sure we have one on the spot 
i think because it looked i don't know <background> 
(()) 
romeo three bravo two 
alright so we've got someone else also in the living room but while i'm in the dining room i'm going to get rid of the fire that 
was %uh left over from this explosion 
%uh still a few more spots to take care of but 
we see fire spreading now at romeo three bravo one 
alright checking on another point of interest that's in the kitchen we actually do have someone this time i will move so that's the second point and then three four are going to convert the 
it's right by that entrance

has an explosion here which forces fire 
over <background> 
%uh at romeo six bravo eight 
here damage counters to walls and three separate parts of the living room that's just 
we have another explosion unfortunately that goes through the kid's bedroom into the dining room 
%um 
fills up the small bathroom 
hell on earth over <background> 
and some more damage counters at the exterior wall over 
that'll blow yeah that'll blow that door open in the game room <background> 
alright i'm going to check on this point of interest in the kitchen 
we do have a cat so i'm going to step back towards 
the exit in the game room and get rid of that smoke 
yup 
fire is also now at romeo six bravo one 
oh no this is this is smoke before so i i flipped it over there <background> 
alright <background> 
i'm going to get 
that's sorry that's just some smoke over

alright i forgot that i had a banked point for a little while ago i never looked down 
and i think i'm going to have to step back into the living room 
so really the smoke there and get this dog out of there 
and start doing something about this so a little bit of <background> 
%um 
fire converted to smoke 
let's see 
point of interest now at romeo one bravo two which is not possible because there's too much fire there 
romeo one 
bravo two wow the living room is going back up in flames an explosion 
romeo five bravo one which is not possible because there's fire in the dining room 
%uh also leading to the master bath now 
romeo four bravo eight 
alright going to get this cat out of there 
we do have 
point of interest in the game room 
yeah not not the best place to be but no ~POIS over there 
that's my whole %uh turn i'll probably end up moving into the living room or another 
however 
fire at romeo 
%uh 
fire area instead of checking on the people 
four bravo one 
actually i forgot to roll for a ~POI (()) 
is actually just turning in 
romeo five bravo five 
romeo one bravo seven nope 
smoke into fire so no explosion luckily over 
smoke turn into fire it looks like that whole side of the house is starting to go over 
romeo two bravo two that's impossible 
romeo four bravo one alright 
yeah absolutely %uh after a couple of explosions in the kid's bedroom the small bathroom 
i spoke too soon there is a ~POI in there in the living room 
are and is %uh blowing open doors into the dining room 
that whole %er north 
(()) 
side of the house 
is looking really bad %uh some patches of fire 
mhm <background> 
in the kitchen as is usual but %uh really just smoke everywhere else we got a point of interest in the living room 
game room 
and %uh i guess i got to roll for another one actually good 
somehow avoided being sent to the hospital because every other 
good to see that there romeo four 
bravo one we we do have another point of interest 
every other coordinate in the living room is on fire except for where i'm standing 
right at that entrance exit 
%uh 
%uh over 
the same goes for the small bathroom the kid's bedroom is about to be completely filled up %uh 
or wait that's green fire fighter 
the green fire fighter has 
a victim in the master bath that they're working on we have point of interest in kitchen and the game room that we need to still 
find out 
if they're people or not 
going to remove the fire 
to the left and in front of me 
in the living room 
alright %um 
copy 
and 
%um 
going to step in check to see we have a there's a 
see that it's spreading at romeo five bravo three 
i'm going to 
false flag here at the entrance 
well 
so this is will be a bad reaction of smoke at that coordinate 
i promised help in the dining room it looks like you got that exit alright i'm going to step into the living room 
i'm going to step right back out 
and into the game room i'm going to check on that one next time 
is now fire and spreading 
and at least tackle some of this 
%um rolling for a point a point of interest at romeo two bravo three 
so dining room 
%uh it's one two three four trying the ~POI the next turn 
on fire 
but no victims in there over 
alright so another 
and romeo three bravo five 
point of interest here in the living room kind of smoky 
you got smoke 
but 
in the kitchen but not turning into fire unfort- or fortunately over <background> 
we're seeing more smoke 
at romeo five bravo eight 
that is another explosion 
now the walls here are going to get it the worst 
because you can't blow through a door 
yup <background> 
oh no <background> 
but 
we now have a hole in that small bathroom to the exterior 
so 
was that over okay <background> 
fire there 
%uh 
damage yeah 
one two three 
that's that's all 
four just still working on this living room for now 
alright <background> 
%uh 
~POI is a confirmed 
we at now have a path cleared though if this is a victim in the kitchen i'll be able to get them out 
person 
i'm going to put out 
%uh a little bit easier <background> 
the smoke next to us 
romeo five bravo six 
alright while i'm here i'm going to see %uh 
we have an explosion in the kid's bedroom 
that was two points 
we got a dog what's up with him 
which now fills that up 
or that was three points 
and move 
spreads into the dining room through the hole in the wall 
%uh 
the next turn i'll be able to get him out 
i'm going to bank a point then because i can't move 
and %uh 
alright romeo two bravo four 
seeing the fire 
damage counters here 
i think i just did that yeah that's what i meant <background> 
smoke is turning into fire over here in the master bath over 
before my eyes %uh 
actually it was just smoke smoke in the kitchen 
i'm going to get this dog out we got a pet 
another pet saved %uh 
i think i'm going to have to get into the living room here with all this smoke popping up <background> 
%um 
okay 
another point of interest at romeo three bravo seven 
i'm going to roll for point of interest see if we can work on one 
so another game room interest 
at romeo three 
point 
alright i got to get this victim out while i can other side of the living room is looking really bad so 
bravo three 
and 
%uh another 
romeo two bravo four 
point of interest in the kitchen right by me actually those are lucky 
we have an explosion in the master bath 
make sense to do that rolling for another ~POI at romeo two bravo eight 
i will check 
%uh luckily that's not affecting any of that smoke in the living room 
it was a false flag 
no that's where the fire in the master bedroom is romeo six bravo three 
it is just going to leave me to fight the fire here 
we're looking at now a hole into the kitchen 
even more action in the dining room we have another ~POI right by the door <background> 
one two three okay 
and some damage to the wall between the master bath and the living room over 
looking good 
%uh s- 
romeo one bravo three 
the whole north side of the house there's no victims but there's all that fire 
however another living room explosion 
hopefully this roll 
it's spreading through the shock wa- shock wave in the master bath 
of romeo four bravo four 
alright just some smoke 
%uh 
oh do not need to roll for fire it looks like 
and damaging the exterior wall as well 
then we're 
%uh might have to leave this side of the house alone for a while all the ~POIS are right by you over 
oh 
that's a point of interest 
at romeo four bravo four thank you thank you <background> 
alright 
%um (()) points in here alright getting rid of the smoke and moving over to check on this point of interest alright we do have somebody 
it's an alley oop <background> 
%uh right now i'm just going to get rid of the smoke that where she's at 
%um 
the next turn i'll see what i can do with the other point of interest 
alright <background> 
one 
%uh right now 
two three four that another piece of fire to the living room 
at romeo six bravo three 
some smoke in the dining room over <background> 
alright %um 
working into the corner 
and 
more fire being extinguished there in the living room over 
yeah all all romeo one coordinates are currently on fire <background> 
alright good call <background> 
they're all in a row <background> 
alright let's see a point of interest 
okay smoke 
now we have two points of interest 
now gone in that corner of the master bath 
confirmed to be people in the living room 
going to remove that fire 
two three 
going to start making one 
%uh and that's it over 
%uh a little bit closer to the door 
romeo one bravo four 
alright %uh 
we have an explosion in the master bath 
going to go at enter 
that's going to actually be a a death sentence here for 
the dining room one two three four and i'll use that banked point to see 
that's a relief alright last corner 
with fire and that living room is taken care of 
the one i don't have 
if our first ~POI is someone and it is 
in my arms 
%um 
i think i will 
%uh 
the fire hopefully stays on the other side of the house contained well not really contained but you know 
remove a damage counter here 
we had to lose one that explosion also 
while it's next to me 
not near us the living room continues to fill up with smoke probably due to all that fire and red your go over 
doing damage and 
hitting the kitchen 
alright got to roll for another point of interest unfortunately after that victim we lost 
romeo one bravo eight we have another 
wow <background> 
point of interest in the master bed 
%uh over 
(()) 
alright %um 
since we have two points of interest in the kitchen 
i'm going to make my way in there one two three %uh my last point will be to get rid of the smoke next to them 
fire at romeo six bravo 
four 
alright %um i'm able to move move the move her to the exit not out though 
some more in the living room dining room 
%um at romeo five bravo one

we have two people 
confirmed in the kitchen %um 
%uh 
got the exit in sight 
i'm unable to get this 
that was 
in the dining room there 
%uh victim out 
all i can do for now so i'm going to bank a point

at romeo six bravo four

still some more smoke in our 
romeo two 
current location

over 
(())

there's a person here i'm going to extinguish these flames 
right by the smoke in the living room there's a new point of interest right by you and 
or the smoke

more fire has spread in the kitchen over <background> 
there's a new point of interest though and they are at

new point of interest in the master bedroom over 
yeah <background> 
put out 
bring this flame down to some smoke and 
got you copy alright i'm going to go back in through this wall thing 
put out this smoke 
and carry the person outside

we're outside now but the dining room's still pretty fiery 
copy 
another has is there another point of interest that we need to find 
taking this person out 
a little bit of smoke 
%um and i am 
%um there's a new point of interest at bravo six romeo four

in the kitchen where it's quite fiery %um 
%um there's been an explosion in the master bedroom damage to 
copy green %um i 
(()) 
so we should maybe try to get in there at some point soon

so i'm going to start making my way in there 
the walls 
going to enter 
and bravo five romeo three there is 
and doors opened over <background> 
the master bedroom 
again to reach the point of interest 
no

and i'm going to 
bravo five ro- romeo six 
s- walk here it's getting really loud 
see that there is a cat here and we're going to start making our way out 
%uh can't do anything else 
there is another point of interest in the dining room by the piano

the kitchen 
doors blown open wall damage over 
copy

there is now some smoke in the master bedroom right behind you 
%um

c- over 
house is the master bedroom is completely in flames and the walls are damaged

but the fire has now spread to bravo seven romeo one 
into the game room since there's someone here going to walk in

there's now some smoke in the master bedroom 
could maybe be good 
to enter in through the door and put out some of those flames 
going to put out 
this fire into some smoke it's smoky 
over 
it would take about the same amount of work to break down the wall <background>

i've just exited the dining room with a person saved them 
and turn that to smoke 
so i'm still in the master bedroom i'm going to see where the fire is spreading <background> 
%um i'm going to come around to the other side of the house 
%uh to get towards the fires and the people in the master bath so i'm going to move in and i'm now in the master bedroom facing the master bath 
oh okay the fire is not spreading great over <background> 
%um 
i'm going to see where the fire is spreading bravo one romeo two we have an explosion in the living room <background> 
so we've got more fire and we've got some 
is that over okay alright i'm took a woman outside now i'm trying to figure out where i should move next <background> 
the starts of some holes in the walls 
in the living room and i'm going to see where there is another person of interest i've heard screams 
%uh bravo eight romeo one that is one person potential person in the master bedroom where i am actually 
%um 
we only have point of person of interest now in the house somehow 
alright i guess i'm going to move towards the living room 
there's okay yeah i'm going to go outside 
and i'm going to put this fire out 
i'll go to- i'll go into the master bath <background> 
in the living room 
so i'm still outside the house over <background> 
and then getting through the door now 
firefighter on the duty here i'm going to %um 
%uh but i can't really move any farther 
looks like we have a 
point of interest in the ba- master bath that looks like the easiest thing to start with 
i'm going to have to wait until i get some more 
power 
so 
%um 
so let me check and see what other conditions might be coming up here 
i'm on that person 
%um 
and i think i'm done for this turn <background> 
at bravo two 
oh okay i'm not to the person yet <background> 
at %uh romeo two bravo six 
but i'm ready to check out this person nex- next time around 
i'm actually on that spot again 
over oh le- let's find out if there's a new %uh 
%um 
condition coming up 
i'm going to have to put that out i think i will i still have a point i still have enough left to %uh 
at %uh 
bravo eight 
romeo one 
to put that smoke out (()) i think i'll just go ahead and take care of that before i stop here 
we're going from %uh the fire's picking up there 
over 
in the master bedroom 
okay so we've got fire in the master bedroom 
%um which i'm going to be coming out through 
on my next turn i hope 
it's going to take me some ((%uh)) time to get out of here 
over 
okay i'm going to be able to get out of the %uh master bedroom 
%uh so we've got one victim 
safely 
taken out %uh 
let me see if %uh there might be another point of interest 
showing up 
at %uh look if we look at %uh bravo 
okay i've got %um 
two 
romeo four 
i've got a person in the master bath 
bravo two 
romeo four 
i'm going to move to the door 
we have a point of interest we had to look into the %uh 
i'm not at the door yet 
the living room the south 
%uh got to find out if there are more 
the south corner of the living room 
conditions coming 
so %um and there also might be more stuff coming up here let's see if 
at %uh 
bravo 
romeo four 
romeo six 
%uh 
bravo 
eight 
you've got some smoke coming right up next to you red fireman at the dining room 
we've got 
more fire 
look out behind you 
that would just be smoke okay <background> 
over <background> 
so the game room's getting a little hotter but at it's not too bad yet and there isn't anything going on in there i don't think we need to worry too much 
okay so i we've got one out but %uh there's more to look at over 
okay i'm going to 
just get out of here 
into the master bedroom ((you're)) exiting the master bath into the master bedroom i've leave that smoke behind i'm going to head for the exit door 
oh romeo five <background> 
bravo two 
while i tried it before i get there 
we've got another condition at romeo one 
bravo seven which is also in the master bedroom 
i think that's going to be fire coming up closer to the exit door 
so i'm going to try and get out of here on my next 
we've got fire there already <background> 
go around 
over 
bravo <background> 
okay i i i know we have somebody in the living room 
so i'm going to be able to get there and find out what that is 
we have a victim in the living room i- i'm 
on that spot 
i've got i've got this person with me now 
and i think we'll be able to get out %uh pretty soon it's going to take a little while we're not close to the exit door 
okay i'm i'm exiting the master bedroom with a person of interest 
so let me find out what else is going on in the house 
we're safe 
%uh romeo six bravo seven 
%um i'm going to have to hold off awhile and take a break before 
i'm going to i'm going to plan to check out the small bathroom i'm going to try and break through the wall on that 
there's the kid's bedroom 
it's not fully on fire 
but first we need to check out %um 
so be careful about that 
i guess it's actually a good thing because we're not going to get any more points of interest in that location 
there could be another person of interest point of interest at romeo five 
bravo seven 
%uh okay over 
bravo no that can't be right because there's a fire there 
let me look again 
we have romeo three bravo five 
nope that can't be right there's a fire there 
romeo five 
bravo two 
okay 
before you look out the door you're going to have another person point of interest to check out at the dining table 
okay i'm going to be able to get that piece of fire out next to the door <background> 
also 
there's a possible condition getting worse romeo 
%uh 
one 
but i'm still stuck in the living room 
bravo three 
oh wait let me find out if something else is going on here 
that's 
it's in the living room 
romeo four 
we've got lots of fire in the living room now 
bravo five 
over 
we have a lot of fire in the kitchen now it's almost completely engulfed 
i'm still %uh 
hoping to get out of the living room on my next turn 
okay i'm heading for the small bathroom i'm going to break in through the wall 
i think i can get into the room but i can't find out i can't figure out yet what i've got here 
we've got 
a condition coming up at romeo four 
bravo seven 
game room 
got smoke there 
over 
i think you can get a little further out of the %uh you know move toward the door yeah i think you still have a couple of points <background> 
some strength left <background> 
there you go 
good move 
okay i have enough to get my victim out of the living room 
that's all i can do for now so we'll need to see a couple of things now there might be another point of interest 
we're looking at romeo four 
okay 
bravo six 
i'm finding out that %uh we've 
got a pet 
that cat 
no that's not a place that it we can have anybody showing up 
in the bathroom 
do i rescue the cat 
rome three 
i think since i've got the opening in the door right the op- i have an opening through the wall right there 
bravo eight 
so i'm getting the cat out 
we have a new point of interest 
%uh 
in the game room there's already some smoke in that room the door are shut 
let me %um 
%uh from the master bedroom but there's an exterior door should be easy to get in there 
i i think we have to get some more points of interest on the board here 
through the exterior door 
%uh i sh- i'm going to 
i- i'll you go ahead and work on getting your person out of the %uh your getting your cat out of the dining room 
but %uh 
and i'll work on the game room on my next 
bravo 
the next time i get a chance over 
bravo eight romeo six 
okay there's another point of interest in the in the bathroom i'm going to go back i still have one point left i'm going to go back in 
over 
oh wait i have to get a 
another condition's coming up 
romeo six bravo six 
we've got an explosion 
in the 
kid's bedroom <background> 
i think that blows out <background> 
all the walls <background> 
i think that blows the door open 
okay over 
good work i'm going to tr- get in 
i'm going to move to the game room 
i can put out the smoke that's in the game room 
and i'll be able to check out the 
possible victim there 
in a little bit 
let me see what other 
stuff might be coming up 
romeo five 
bravo five 
okay we've got smoke 
just popping up in the %uh 
in the dining room 
in the corner behi- 
next to the piano 
over 
you could try i think we can occupy the same space 
so maybe if you come in through the game room and the two of us you could 
one of us can bust through the wall to the small bathroom there is a point of interest there the other one can work on the 
per- potential victim that's in the game room 
okay i've got two points of interest in the bathroom in the small bathroom where i'm standing now 
okay i'm going to go ahead and blast through the wall 
into the small bathroom 
and find out what's in there 
going to check out the first 
%um so that's %uh 
that's a definite person 
i'm going to get this person out 
that's going to use me up for this turn but we definitely have a victim in the bathroom i need to get her out on the next 
and then 
i'm back into the bathroom 
on the next %uh chance i get 
to find out 
%um 
%uh let's find out if there's anything getting worse 
who the what the next point of interest might be there 
maybe at bravo one 
but i can't find out yet i- i'm not 
romeo one 
i can't get there 
we've got smoke 
%um in terms of %uh 
in the living room 
in addition to the fire that's already there 
we might have another point of interest at romeo one 
over 
bravo eight 
no we don't that's a fire 
%um 
let me try that again 
romeo four 
bravo 
eight 
okay the game room has a point of interest there's something going on there's going to be something to look for in there 
%uh it's right next to the door to the outside so we should be able to figure that out we should be able to find that out quickly 
%um 
checking on the status of the plays right now the %uh 
bravo six romeo five 
looks like we have an explosion <background> 
there's an explosion in the kids bedroom 
i think that place is that part of the house is pretty well toast 
oh okay 
over 
yeah <background> 
okay i'm going to get my person out of the small bathroom that's going to use me up i'm i'm spent 
%um let's find out if there's another point of interest 
at romeo six 
bravo three 
okay we have two p- two potential victims 
at the entry door from the outside in the living room so that's going to take a lot of work to get both of those people out 
%uh in addition we also have 
a person still in the master bedroom we ha- your 
positioned pretty well to get to that person you need to open the door first 
and to get into there but then you can probably make a quick exit directly from the master bedroom out of the north side there's an exit door there 
so %um 
i think i'm i think we're done i have to find out if there another condition clearing up 
%uh romeo three 
bravo four 
yeah we have an explosion in the kitchen 
%uh that 
blows open a door 
and does damage to a couple of walls 
so the %um 
the dining room and the living room walls are 
%uh 
compromised 
for the you know where they join to the kitchen 
and the kitchen itself is almost completely engulfed 
okay 
okay 
i need to find out who el- 
what's going on in the small bathroom 
what yes i can i can get started on the dining room but there's more fire in the %uh in the living <background> 
we've got a person 
in the small bathroom 
it's all i can do to get next to the 
hole that's been that i made in the wall i can't get out yet 
yeah th- there's a lot of fire there's still a lot of smoke in the living room 
but i think it'll be good to get the %uh person out of the master bedroom first 
conditions at romeo six 
so you p- i suggest you go to the master bedroom <background> 
bravo three 
there's 
no oh good good that's a good idea 
that's in the dining room at the entry way from the outside 
well there's smoke there was smoke there al- at the next right next to that already <background> 
okay <background> 
so we've got lot yeah lots of smoke in the dining room <background> 
we have another explosion <background> 
so now 
i'm almost ready to get out of the bathroom with the person 
the %uh 
oh 
and then as soon as that's out i'm going to help out with the game room 
like that 
so yeah 
looks like a lot of damage in the kitchen 
%uh most of the walls are compromised 
%uh except that there's a game room door tha- the game room's now is now on there's now fire in the game room 
%uh 
so yeah things are looking pretty good mid- at the center of the house 
yeah time for me to get moving i'm going to head for the %uh 
i'm going to head for the dining room 
i can get in <background> 
i can grab one of these people 
oh wai- i can let me find out who wh- i'll find out who one of these %uh 
okay i'm 
i'm getting out of the small bathroom with the 
potential victims is 
with a rescue 
we have a definite victim 
this person is safe now 
so that's used up half my my time i'm going to get out with this person i've saved i've got one victim left 
i can get 
i'm getting put out the smoke that's in the game room 
potential victim i don't know what it is yet 
there's still a potential victim in the %uh 
that uses me up for this turn 
in the dining room 
the there's some smoke in that room a little bit of fire it doesn't look too bad and %uh 
i'm going to check for another point of interest 
potential victim is right next to the door 
romeo one bravo one the living room we have a point of interest 
i'm going to check for another potential victim 
at the far corner of the house 
at romeo 
but it looks like there's a clear path to it from the entry from outside 
two 
bravo five 
over 
we've got a point of interest in the master bath right next to the door entry from the master bedroom 
%uh 
there's more situations coming up at %uh romeo one bravo two 
and we have an explosion in the living room 
so 
that's going to compromise the wall going into the 
dining room 
and also 
%uh 
one of the exterior walls 
the north wall form the %uh 
from the living room and we've got 
the whole living room is fully en- engulfed 
in flame

i think yeah that's a good idea that's the person in the in master bath is more at risk 
okay i've reached the corner of the living room 
i can't figure yet what i've got here 
it's a point of interest but 
i'm going to have to wait until %uh

put out fires in the game room because %uh the dining room is much more important 
i'm not sure what the 
there's going to be damage on the wall we've got to break 
%um but it's going to take everything i've got just to get there 
you should be seeing a red fire person you you've got a %uh 
i'm there now 
and i'll help we'll we'll work on getting people out and putting out everything that's burning or smoking in the dining room over 
you've got a hole in the wall 
to your left 
opening into the living room 
%uh 
due to an explosion in that room i kind of suggest there's nothing else in there you might want to get out of the kitchen 
we need- we need to get somebody out of the dining room 
and it's going to take some time to do that over 
thank you okay 
i'm going to check out i'm going to put out the smoke and check out this point of interest we have a victim 
so this 
victim is safe 
but i'll have to get her out at the next move

romeo four bravo five 
that's 
the kitchen is getting much worse now 
we have damage

with a person 
and i'm going to move to 
the dining room

so 
i am going to move my person out so that's two action points 
okay i am going to take a similar first step and i'm going to make a hole in the small bathroom right near our first point of interest 
there two more here 
and then i just have to hang out by the door until my next turn 
%uh and i am going to roll bravo first this time so that's bravo two 
rolling for the fire now

another explosion in the living room 
in your first turn <background> 
%uh and start attacking 
the fire from that side on my

fire here fire here 
and %uh 
bravo five romeo five

so can't %uh oh right here yup 
okay <background> 
so we got two persons of interest in the dining room seems like my best bet for where to go next 
so i'm rolling for my point of interest now i got romeo one bravo five 
%um i'm outside so my first step is going to be 
so 
inside here 
and then i'll take two steps this way and reveal this point of interest as a person 
right there <background> 
%uh i'll roll for the fire now bravo three 
romeo four

not going to work 
okay so someone in the game room 
okay so i am going to take a step greet my person 
i had that backwards <background> 
%uh <background> 
so that's one 
take a step back that's three and i will bank an action point for my next turn 
sounds good %uh 
%um rolling now to see the fire bravo three romeo two 
red do you recommend that i focus on the point of interest or <background> 
we have another explosion in 
red can you hear me do you do you recommend i focus on the point of interest or take care of the fire first <background> 
the living room 
so that's fire here and damage between the wall for the master bath 
okay so this door to the master bath is already open right 
damage between the wall for the kitchen 
so i am going to take care of this smoke 
%uh and that fire just got placed s- no damage there 
%uh over 
with my first action point move in with my second 
and move closer to the point of interest with the third flip it over for a fourth 
and it's a person 
%uh rolling now for the new fire 
romeo five bravo seven so romeo five bravo seven that's another explosion in the kid's bedroom 
%uh so 
okay so %uh 
damage counter here here 
two more steps with my person 
here 
and here 
to here 
still have an action point banked rolling now to see where the fire ends up 
okay <background> 
bravo five romeo four 
so we have another explosion in the kitchen 
%uh roll over 
we got damage here 
damage here 
%uh this door is blown open be careful red 
and we have more fire in the kitchen 
%uh over 
okay so i'm going to try and get this person out of here so 
moving one space here takes two action points moving here takes another two action points 
okay 
%uh <background> 
%uh rolling for the new fi- oop 
that's romeo four bravo eight that's <background> 
smoke in the master bedroom <background> 
okay taking a step out 
romeo four bravo eight 
takes away two points %uh saving 
so 
one person 
we have more smoke in the game room 
%uh i'm going to roll for a new point of interest first 
or is this fire now 
bravo four romeo five 
smoke <background> 
%uh roll over <background> 
%uh 
so we have a new point of interest 
in the dining room 
%um 
so i am going to 
take a step back in 
take a step over and use my banked action point to reveal this point of interest as a dog 
%uh and for the fire bravo eight romeo six we have smoke in the small bathroom 
over 
do we have damage counters <background> 
over here as well 
okay so %uh i take two action points to get my person outside 
%uh and then 
okay 
i'm going to step back into the same room and i'm going to turn this one closer to the wall into smoke for my last 
so going to 
greet the pup 
take a step back with him 
so that's three points i'm going to bank a point 
action point 
%uh romeo two bravo eight for the new 
bravo one romeo six 
buyer 
and that is smoke in the master bedroom 
we have smoke in the dining room over 
roll over <background> 
%uh sure so romeo six bravo four 
(()) 
(()) 
in the game room <background> 
three victims in five minutes okay 
%uh stepping out 
%uh takes 
four points 
but i still have a point banked so that's one of the three saved that's a dog 
%um 
okay 
going to roll for a new point of interest first 
so i'm going to work on putting out the fire in the living room 
%uh bravo four romeo six 
i'm going to start by taking out the smoke closest to the wall that's a single action point then i'm going to take out the fire 
we have a new point of interest in the game room i'm going right back in %uh for my last action point over 
right here that's two more action points 
%uh wait re- let me roll for the fire so bravo three romeo two 
and then i'm going to take a step back into the master bath 
we have an explosion in the living room 
%uh that's fire here 
%uh for my last action point 
%uh a hole blown open into the master bath and a hole blown open into the kitchen 
%um rolling 
%uh almost done almost done my turn here 
%um more damage on the living room exterior over 
romeo six bravo three 
%uh 
that is smoke next to the cat in the dining room %uh question is the cat worth saving okay does it does it still take two action points to get a cat outside okay <background> 
fair enough fair enough i agree %um 
roll over <background> 
an explosion in the kitchen <background> 
so <background> 
%uh this door's blown open so <background> 
right 
no <background> 
%uh damage here <background> 
damage here we got lots of holes blown open maybe a good thing if we can get this fire out 
okay %uh so i'm going to reveal my point of interest it's a person <background> 
%um 
okay so 
first thing i'm going to do is reveal this point of interest it's a person 
i'm going to take a step 
with %uh towards them and then back with them to finish my turn 
%um so i'm going to take a step towards him and then a step back with him 
%uh 
%um for all four of my action points 
romeo one bravo two 
rome- or bravo three romeo six 
so we have %uh fire or smoke right on top of me 
%uh yes roll over <background> 
i would go for the bathroom %um 
i would also roll for another point of interest <background> 
and i believe 
this extends through these holes 
this is now fire and there's fire here <background> 
so things are getting out of out of hand quick let's just get these other two people saved and then focus on the fire then so the first thing i'm going to do is take out that smoke since i'm right next to it so that's one <background> 
should we <background> 
roll roll for two more points of interest <background> 
that takes three to get my person of interest outside so that's two people saved of the three we need to 
bravo eight romeo four that's not going to work <background> 
%um and i'm going to roll for another point of interest first so bravo five romeo three 
one <background> 
five <background> 
%uh can't happen that's in the kitchen bravo two romeo three 
%uh can't happen that's in the living room 
okay 
so %uh let's see i can take two steps with my person to get him outside 
bravo one romeo three nope 
bravo four romeo three 
nope 
bravo seven romeo six 
and i believe that is all i can do 
no 
%um 
bravo five romeo two <background> 
oh okay 
okay fire <background> 
in the master bath oh that is a point of interest you're right okay so %uh for my last action point i'm just going to take a step back into the game room over <background> 
romeo two bravo seven for the new fire 
so we have more smoke in the master bedroom and i'll roll for another point of interest <background> 
oh (()) <background> 
so we have romeo two bravo three 
so we got <background> 
point of interest in the living room <background> 
pretty dangerous i'll try and go back in for that one soon %uh roll over <background> 
so can we confirm that was our third person saved <background> 
yes <background> 
yeah <background> 
okay %uh 
so we still have two points of interest on the board right now do you want to roll for another point of interest <background> 
right next to me 
(()) 
perfect so first thing i'm going to do is reveal that point of interest as a person <background> 
take a step towards them for two of my action points take a step back for the last two 
okay so 
first action point taking a step back into the living room the second revealing that we do have a person in the living room 
%um 
bravo two romeo five 
we have smoke building in the dining room over 
%um 
third i'm just going to move to that space and fourth i'm going to turn this into smoke 
so now 
romeo four bravo one 
we have more fire in the living room 
yes <background> 
so 
okay 
romeo four bravo seven for a new point of interest 
taking a step out with my person is two of my action points %uh rolling quickly to see where our new point of interest is bravo two romeo five 
%uh <background> 
if there's already smoke can we still okay <background> 
%uh that is another person in the game room %um 
perfect <background> 
%uh roll over <background> 
but i think we should deal with 
the living room first 
so 
i am going to be over here 
and take this smoke out for one of my last action points and take a step in with my other action point <background> 
%um bravo three romeo one 
%uh that's right on top of me that's fire 
right here <background> 
okay so %uh 
i'm going to take 
two steps out 
do you want to bank that point or take care of that smoke 
with my person of interest 
%uh safely escorting them outside <background> 
and that is all my action points for the turn 
i'm going to roll first for a new fire and then for a new point of interest so romeo two bravo four 
for our new fire 
romeo two bravo four we have more smoke in the master bathroom %uh now for the point of interest 
okay 
%um 
romeo two bravo eight 
so 
in that case let's take care of some fire so i'm going to 
%uh we have a new point of interest in the master bedroom that is getting pretty smoky roll over 
yes so i'm going to take out this fire with two of my action points take a step back in and then take out this smoke with another action point over 
okay %um i'm going to start taking out some fire next to you so that's two of my action points take a step over turn this into smoke over 
okay %uh 
red what would you recommend i do here should i go for the master bedroom <background> 
okay <background> 
okay %um then i am going to 
take a step in here 
+okay 
so 
to the master bedroom i'm going to reveal my point of interest for my +second second action point it is a person 
i am going <background> 
%um for my third and fourth action point i'm going to step back outside rescuing that person 
%uh finishing my turn <background>

another another job well done 
take out 
this smoke with one point take a step closer and take out this fire with my last two points over 
romeo two 
bravo two 
so 
more fire in the living room <background> 
is that an explosion since it was just smoke 
right here was just smoke is that an explosion <background> 
okay <background> 
okay %uh taking a step forward and then taking out the fire in the kitchen for three points taking step into the kitchen for a fourth point over 
okay so i am going to take out this fire 
and this one over 
weren't you rolling for a point of interest yeah okay <background> 
that is a dangerous spot <background> 
okay %uh the first thing i'm going to do is roll for a new point of interest 
heard <background> 
%uh bravo eight romeo two 
alright <background> 
%uh we have 
%um so 
a person of interest in the master bedroom 
i'm going to approach in through the living room 
%um and then for my turn 
%um 
i am going to take a step forward and take out this fire 
and first thing i'm going to do can i enter from this side and put out this fire okay so 
and turn this into smoke over 
that's two points to take it out third point to enter 
over <background> 
fourth point to reveal that it is a person and now i will roll for the new fire that's romeo one bravo two 
okay %um 
so that's an explosion in the living room 
so then i am going to take out this smoke take a step this way and then take out this fire over 
right here so 
that takes that person out <background>

three 
%uh double point of interest <background> 
and then 
bravo two romeo six 
(()) 
so we have more smoke in the dining room be careful red over <background> 
%uh it looks like the person in the master bedroom is very much in danger i would try and enter through that door and take care of that 
okay %uh so <background> 
%uh you want to roll for another point of interest <background> 
i think i am going to abandon the living room we don't have any more points of interest there and it's looking pretty gnarly 
so i'm going to exit and then come back in through the master bedroom so that's %uh 
okay well then the first thing i'll do is take a look at my person of interest it is a person so 
one to exit one to get back in 
i will then %uh 
two to take the smoke out or 
so that was one action point move this direction and then bank another action point for my next turn 
one to smo- take the smoke out so that's three and then i'll take another step closer to our point of interest <background> 
let's see what's going on with the fire

%uh rolling now for the fire 
romeo five bravo three 
and i still have another action point 
so we have an explosion in the dining room

the far corner of the dining room by the table 
%um behind the table

alright green fire fighter here i'm going to move out to that hole in the wall with my point of interest bring them to safety and then again reserve my energy for the next turn rolling for a point of interest 
bravo seven %uh romeo four

to play a game in the game room with the other point of interest over 
alright %um 
green fire fighter here oh no 
%um i'm going to reenter through the dining room with one point and then i am going to move to my left to get a point of interest %um one more to turn them over it is a person and two more to move back in front of the door over 
alright green fire oh sorry <background> 
alright green fire fighter here i have a point of interest we are going to move 
two to move out the door into safety one more back in and one more to the point of interest to my left over 
%uh bravo two romeo six for a ~POI 
is also right where i am so now i have two alright over <background> 
alright green fire fighter here i'm going to reenter into the game room <background> 
on top of a point of interest check who they are 
it is a false alarm 
%um 
and then i'm going to reserve my last two bits of energy 
for next go rolling for a new point of interest 
romeo of bravo two romeo three 
%uh that is fire 
bravo four romeo three 
also fire 
%uh green or red <background> 
bravo five romeo two there is now a point of interest in the master bath near the door to the master bedroom over 
over <background> 
alright green fire fighter here %um do i need to use two action points for each person i'm carrying <background> 
%uh one at a time alright so i'm going to carry 
alright green fire fighter here i am going to 
%um 
%uh 
i'm going to identify them it is a person 
move through the game room and ((then)) into the master bedroom through the door 
that's one then i'm going to use two to move in front of the door and then bank one for next time over 
now there i'm with a point of interest i'm going to check who they are 
it is a dog and them i am going to move them to safety 
%um rolling bravo one romeo four 
there is now a point of interest established in the living room next to the outside door over 
over 
alright %uh green fire fighter here i'm using two to move outward with my person they are 
alrighty %um looks like we've got most of our fire happening in the kitchen and living room and maybe even the kid's bedroom so my best starting point might be just over here in the living room 
i'm going to get started 
moving in taking care of %um the fire by the kitchen door 
and i'll go ahead and %um move closer to both for now 
and we'll see where the fire advances it looks like 
bravo six and romeo six 
so we've actually already got fire there it looks like we're going to have an explosion in the kid's bedroom 
%um so 
we're going to have 
this door open 
%um this wall's going to have trouble 
%uh we'll have fire here now 
so the whole kid's bedroom 
%um and going that way we would have damage to that wall i believe 
alright yeah %uh before that turned to fire i was debating %uh another act- now i'm trying to see if i have a different idea here but 
that's that's it for the explosion in the kid's bedroom so 
%um over to you dave 
%um 
i think %uh i will go ahead and try and %uh use some time to run into the dining room check on a point of interest here to see if it's something we need to be concerned with 
okay so i- i've gone to our point of interest but i can't tell what we're dealing with quite yet 
%um looks like we might have more fire 
coming up at bravo two romeo four 
%um so yeah definitely that looks like it's going to be fire versus smoke because it's near %uh the living room and kitchen fires over 
it's unrelenting 
can we've also got a firefighter next door <background> 
wha- what happens to %uh 
normally a person of interest with when you get fire there they are a victim is this firefighter still in the game <background> 
okay fair enough <background> 
roger that thank you alright let's see if we are dealing with anybody right now <background> 
and we are 
%um before i move anywhere else i'm going to take care of the smoke behind me 
saw it happening ran out of the house i'll be back in 
thanks for the heads up 
okay and with a little more effort i can make it 
a little farther in the dining room 
looks like there might be 
some smoke coming up though in the corner here 
bravo five romeo 
alrighty i'm going to try and head back in i do know %uh where where of a point of interest in the master bath which might be the closest person <background> 
sorry actually 
smoke coming up %um right here in the master bath where you guys are so godspeed over 
%um so i'll do one two 
so i 
(()) 
(())  feel like i'm doing the same thing i did last time %um took care of it the fire there %uh but i don't feel like i have any more 
action points to help out further but i'm going to 
hang tight 
i have bravo five and romeo five 
coming at us with more fire looks like the 
dining room is getting hit now from the kitchen and kid's bedroom 
great thanks for the update 
%um it looks like i can make it to the doorway but not quite through the door with my person of interest 
sorry i feel like i did this last time too always bringing the fire 
%um on 
alright over <background> 
this go 
and it looks like 
%um bravo six and romeo red %um romeo five is going to have an explosion in the kid's bedroom where there was a- almost a full fire 
yeah i'll put them in the hospital area 
%um so let's see what that looks like 
%uh we have got some damaged walls into the dining room and into the kitchen 
%um extending to the small bathroom where there actually is a point of interest we need to be concerned with 
%um all the way to %uh the outside house wall of the kid's bedroom 
%um 
that should be it for now over 
roger that thank you alright i'm going to take care of %uh the person we have already 
go ahead and save them and %um before i had a way to work on that i do want to get back inside see if i can't figure out what's going on 
(()) 
with %uh 
alright real fast i'm going to take %uh care of 
the person across the si- the dining room table from me 
%um just minimizing 
%uh minimizing this 
%uh there may be 
going around here 
more happening at bravo three 
romeo five 
and bumping in here trying to see what we're dealing with 
in the meantime over 
we do have a person 
i feel like i i am not certain i have enough %um 
energy to get back out %uh but we're almost there 
alright 
let's see where the fire's going 
we've got bravo seven romeo six 
okay we've already got fire here so now we are dealing with an explosion %uh next door in the kid's bedroom 
%um looks like this door is going to be opened we're going to have a busted wall here 
roger that makes sense it's kind of in the middle of everything %um i'm going to check on what we have here 
busted wall here into the game room 
and 
move one 
damage %uh to the wall with the door a- already open <background> 
check we do have a person here 
so i am going to move away from that smoke with %uh 
alright 
the time i have 
i have %uh my person almost outside i have %uh one step to the door %uh we do have another point of entrance in the master bath and in the corner of the dining room neither of those rooms have a the fire in them yet so we're in good shape there but %uh it's it's not looking great in the kitchen or the living room or the kid's bedroom over 
bravo five 
romeo six is going to start smoking up though 
in the corner from my exit over 
so %uh firefighter dave at this point we're not sure %uh if the the point of interest in the dining room is a red flag or not right we're not sure <background> 
you you weren't able to turn that over on your turn correct <background> 
okay alright well we the yeah now we definitely know it's not just a red flag got to got to give you our resources <background> 
i think you're right 
and %um that was 
six and six correct 
i think we might just have a- an opening here now as well is that correct 
okay great 
i am a couple steps away from %uh saving 
another person on %uh 
great alright let's get %um 
this turn %um i do want to check and see if there's anyone else we're dealing with %uh to check on but we do have a lot of blazes going on in the master bedroom the living room the kitchen and still in the kid's bedroom there's also smoke in the dining room 
i'm going to 
move with my person 
we went ahead and saved another person there %um 
i might take advantage of your hole in the bathroom and try and take care of this kid's %uh 
%um over 
%uh let's see there might be a 
kid's %uh (()) - 
point of interest in %um bravo 
sorry this was over here i believe so okay 
six romeo four 
then i'm going to have to hang tight but i'm right outside the kid's bedroom for more assistance in a moment 
right here very close to the blazes 
but not yet yet in danger 
and looks like 
there will be more fire right where i'm standing that is my luck today okay %um 
and %uh there might be some more smoke or fire coming in bravo eight 
romeo five 
alright looks like we're going to give you some smoke in that small bathroom 
we just add smoke there or are we we dealing just re-rolling 
okay <background> 
smoke we can handle 
perhaps i mixed up what i was rolling for 
over <background> 
alright bravo eight romeo fiv- actually still right there that seems like 
be aware you've got a couple more %uh points of interest in your small bathroom then just the one you were aware of after the ((cat))  
%um 
makes a lot of sense you're in good shape 
but the fire might still be escalating at bravo four romeo three 
actually that looks like it's going to be an explosion coming from the kitchen 
%uh so we now have a- a busted wall into the living room the door has been blown open for a full on fire into the living room 
we have %uh a busted door 
alright 
or a busted wall coming from the kitchen to the dining room 
going to %um take care of this fire 
not sure yet if that smoke is going to automatically turn to 
%uh ((with a couple)) and move forward and go ahead and 
%um 
fire %uh but we definitely have more fire there in the kitchen and 
since you do have %um 
i'll go ahead and make %uh 
get this guy down to smoke since he's closer to your with %uh 
a 
busted wall in the kitchen into the game room 
an open door 
and stop there 
over 
and we've got %um fire happening at 
again in the game room some more smoke happening there 
%uh over 
has the fire spread anywhere else okay <background> 
yeah likely spot <background> 
i think you were right that it wasn't just going to be smoke that you had to set it down on fire because it was right next to fire 
alrighty <background> 
i'm going to have to %um 
take care of the fire in here 
you've ((are more to)) take care of this one 
and i'll move over here with what i've got left in the kid's bedroom so that ((hopes)) that i can finish that off shortly 
okay is there anything more we need to do for the explosion here 
looks like maybe we can bust this wall 
and we have %um additional smoke happening 
by the small bathroom 
now in the 
okay 
bathroom next to the kid's bedroom over 
do we oh 
yeah okay and i don't think we need any smoke where you're standing green firefighter 
but yeah but %uh just 
some areas for concern but you're good to go otherwise 
okay for now 
%um 
(( ))  think i will go ahead and- and go around the house just 
to check in %um the game room and the kitchen points 
because the 
okay so i'll go in here 
i'll take some energy just to see no we definitely have a person there 
right <background> 
%um 
so i actually have enough to just get them back out but i will not be able to check on the person in the kitchen who is in danger as well 
on this turn 
got you <background> 
it looks like bravo seven and romeo one 
%um yeah but i we were going to put another point of entrance there but looks like that's not going to be an option right now %um let's see if there's something else we need to check on %um 
we have six and six again no there as well 
what about bravo two and romeo two no there as well 
bravo seven romeo four 
okay we do have another point of entrance there %uh 
blocking my way from the game room to the kitchen 
in the meantime lets see what's happened to the blaze bravo six 
roger that 
%um i'm very close to the fire on the kid's bedroom %um as well as the person of interest 
and romeo four 
okay we do have some smoke happening now %um to the person in the kitchen so i do want to %uh prioritize them right now %uh versus the other person %uh possible person in the game room 
%uh both person of interests i guess on this side of the house %um let me take care of the fire in the kid's bedroom before that escalates 
and i will go ahead and move 
over 
so i have %um made it to the small bathroom i just don't have enough energy left to see who we're dealing with if anyone %uh but i will check in shortly 
and %uh looks like fire may be advancing in 
bravo two romeo six 
okay so now we have a little bit more smoke coming on near our other person of interest over 
is it possible this was just smoke for right now by your exit <background> 
alright so we still have a good dining room exit then sounds good <background> 
i see that thank you thankfully you busted into this bathroom earlier alright let's see 
alright 
i'm going to move into the house 
and %um looks like i can get all the way here 
okay i actually have a false alarm here in the bathroom 
by opening this door i will not be able to check yet if this person 
%um so i'm going to take care of 
%uh is a person or just a false alarm 
this smoke 
%uh bravo one romeo three (( )) going to have some escalated fire it's actually fire since it is 
and this guy 
%um 
it looks like it my fastest way might just be to %uh go around the outside of the house so i'll be headed that direction momentarily 
exit fire this time around %um so watch out for that exit over 
now you have a person of interest 
correct and i just took one off the board so i'm going to see who else we may have in the house 
and where bravo three 
romeo two 
that actually does have fire so %um we're not looking there 
bravo seven romeo one 
%uh looks like we might have a person of interest there to keep track of 
and i'll see where the fire's advancing 
bravo five and romeo one 
is going to have some smoke there right next to you in the %uh the master bath so do be careful over 
great thank you %um alright i wanted to see if i could put anything out while i'm in here %uh just to de-escalate things since there's a couple points of interest here but now we have that one in the living room i'm going to see first of all if we have anyone to deal with here yeah that is not a false alarm we do have a point of interest in the kitchen 
%um 
think i am going to choose to move them 
forward in the game room for now and with my last 
%uh bit of energy i'm just going to check on this other one and we do have a false alarm there so we don't have to worry about that %um maybe he can head more toward the living room in the near future 
so the sounds like there's some smoke wher- where you are at the door be careful 
and i don't believe %uh i guess it's still raining right now %uh so we are 
alright i want to move towards the dining room %uh with with the time i have 
back to you over 
so i'm going to 
head out here 
and i'll go ahead and move toward the piano and go ahead and check with my last energy yes we do have a person who was hiding at the piano 
%uh so i will probably be able to make quick exit on 
%um as soon as possible fire may be advancing at bravo one romeo one 
great thank you 
looks like i was able to get %uh someone out here 
which makes sense now looks like 
yeah would this be fire or smoke do you think 
and %uh we'll see in a moment 
okay 
where we might have someone else to look out for 
alright so watch out part of the living room is engulfed over 
%uh bravo s- nope not that'd be very close to you but %uh there's fire there already %um bravo four and romeo three fire there as well 
bravo two romeo one 
alright we actually 
don't have fire there just yet so %um we do have a person of interest be aware of that as you are fighting that blaze in the living room 
i appreciate the heads up <background> 
alright thank you i %uh %um as things are heating up i will go ahead and get our person out of here 
so i used up my turn doing that 
%um but we did so safely let's see %um where we have more people %uh to be concerned about bravo three 
romeo five 
it's actually very close to me there's another point of interest 
%uh roger that i think i'm going to come around %uh and enter 
%um and the the fire 
into the living room and aim toward that and the kitchen 
could be advancing at bravo two 
romeo six 
from that way 
%um so i'll go in here i'll go ahead and take 
okay so this is definitely going to be fire now and not just smoke in %uh in the living oh sorry the dining room near our person of interest over 
this down all together 
actually 
maybe i'll move there change it to smoke for now 
and make this guy 
go together 
%um 
i don't do we have all our points of interest on the board 
are we missing one <background> 
okay so let me just check if there's someone else we need to be aware of <background> 
%um bravo two romeo two 
(( )) we've got another point of interest in the 
living room to keep track of 
%um but for timing no more fire over 
great i will 
move toward %uh the kitchen to see what i can contain here 
i'm going to set this aside so we don't make our job harder but you have a few more there as needed 
%um i'll take care of the smoke here and through the door i'll take care of 
looks like you- you're ready for me to move on okay awesome %uh definitely have a a few points of interest in the dining room so i i better just head back in there <background> 
the fire that had been in the kitchen here 
and i i can't get anybody diagonally so i'm going to go into the kitchen now 
and be prepared to work on more momentarily 
%um 
take care of this fire 
%um 
here 
i 
and 
looks like we do need another point of interest on 
%um move forward to the guy who was here first %um i don't have any energy left to see if it's a false alarm or not but i will check shortly 
%uh to keep track of so 
just rolling for that %um bravo four romeo three 
%uh and fire 
there's some fire there 
may be proceeding in bravo five 
bravo two romeo six looks like we have another point of interest very near smoke and an exit in the dining room 
romeo two 
just back toward the master bath it looks like just smoke right now over 
over 
is that %um maybe just smoke right now we think awesome awesome we can handle that <background> 
great alright let's see if we're dealing with anyone specific 
it's not a false alarm i do have a person in the dining room 
%um it looks like 
i can move toward the door with that person %um and i'll bank a point for 
and with that explosion at bravo three 
my next turn 
%uh romeo one

%uh in this house mostly in three rooms only in three rooms right now i assume that's going to get worse kid's bedroom kitchen and living room 
break down the walls 
are all ablaze %uh i am 
burn down the house don't burn down the house just break down the walls <background> 
do you want to do you want to start with the small bathroom and i'm going to start like we did yesterday by making a hole 
at %uh bravo four romeo one 
that was quick 
okay i am going to use 
bravo one romeo six 
%uh my turn 
yeah yeah 
to make 
that's an explosion <background> 
alright i am going to do the same i think making the hole in the living room was actually a mistake 
a hole in the master 
%uh bath to make it easier because there's no spot in the living room would it make more sense honestly to do it over here 
that does that mean the door just opens <background> 
and master bath is a much better place for it 
so that is my my my move and i am going to roll for fire bravo seven 
no the door's just open 
and fire 
since there's that door right there 
next to it 
i guess it doesn't really matter <background> 
romeo five seven and five wow that was quick 
and so we can just move that <background> 
okay i'm going to do it over there (( )) experiment %uh 
a hole in the wall of the living room 
%uh explosion in the kid's bedroom so fire there 
alright i am going to go in 
%uh to make it easier since there's no there's a door over there and a door over there there's no door in the middle so i'm making a door in the middle to the outside alright i'm going to roll for fire now 
%uh through the master bedroom 
and 
damage in 
one move and two move open the doors three 
the walls 
breaking down the walls 
and into the master bath 
the %uh easy way 
%uh bravo eight 
%uh towards the point of interest in bravo four 
romeo one 
%uh there's smoke in the master bedroom i repeat smoke in the master bedroom over 
and 
%uh 
rome two i'm going to roll for fire now 
that is that that's the move over 
%uh bravo four

open the door 
and go over into the master bath that's my turn 
two and three alright that's an explosion <background> 
%uh and hoping that the blaze does not get worse 
and a point of interest

romeo two 
%uh more smoke in the master bedroom

%uh and then i'm going over to enter the living room 
so there's damage to the wall 
%uh the outer wall there's damage to the wall between the kid's bedroom and the game room 
and then i'm rolling for additional fire 
which is at bravo five and romeo six there's a some more smoke mhm red over <background> 
yeah yeah oh we lost our victim oh <background> 
here it should go there <background> 
%um 
and i i think there might be damage to this wall going to the hallway too 
okay red over <background> 
okay okay <background>

okay so i'm 
checking on the status of these 
%uh extinguishing <background> 
both of these victims and it's a 
a boy and his little dog 
i got to get them out 
alright so i'm extinguishing three fires 
soon as i can 
but i it's going to have to be for next time 
and then stepping back out of the living room 
so we'll see what's happening with the fire it looks like it's spreading to 
and then i'm <background> 
and then i'm going to 
bravo seven 
%uh roll for some more fire 
romeo four it's an explosion in the game room <background> 
at bravo six 
so the others damage to the 
romeo five uh-oh

damage to the exterior wall %uh red over <background> 
oh boy <background>

%um 
okay <background> 
you're play p- green repeat <background> 
we need to roll for another point of interest too okay <background> 
i'm %uh 
i hate to do it but i got to prioritize my victims i got to take the two *legger first 
so i'm approaching the master bathroom 
door %um 
and i'm stuck where i am for now 
going to check on the fire spreading to bravo three romeo six 
that's %um 
smoke 
right it b- right in front of the kitchen door red over 
i am %uh going over and i'm going to enter the dining room 
and i'm going to find out who this victim is in the dining room and it's a person 
okay now i'm going to roll for fire <background> 
and so it's bravo six 
romeo four there's more smoke in the kitchen and red turn is over <background> 
green i think we're short a point of interest <background> 
sorry (( )) say again 
oh so %uh 
man okay <background> 
i'm in the dining room which is a little smoky but not too bad kitchen is full of fire and smoke and the living room has a lot of fire and smoke 
okay <background> 
alright i'm 
i've got the %uh male victim and i'm in the master bathroom now and my path out 
looks okay for now into the hallway 
so hope for the best 
%um bravo six romeo two 
there's that smoke has turned into fire next to the little doggie 
%uh red over 
so the kitchen is engulfed in flames <background> 
okay 
i'm taking my victim 
to the door 
this is as far as i can get with him 
so i'm going to roll for additional fire 
so bravo four 
okay %uh 
and romeo four 
i'm going to 
and that's an explosion in the kitchen <extreme_background> 
get this victim 
out into the hallway 
and the other victim and the dog are still 
stuck in that master bedroom hopefully the fire doesn't spread there 
so bravo four romeo two 
red turn over <extreme_background> 
there's 
an explosion in the master bath 
so now there's damage to the wall between the master bath and the living room the master bath and the small bath 
and i think between the master and the master bedroom where there are again two victims 
%um so that's all i can do for now red over 
okay carrying my victim out 
red over <background> 
then i'm going back in 
and 
getting rid of some smoke 
then <extreme_background> 
right then i'm going to %uh roll for an additional point of interest 
bravo eight romeo two 
so there is an additional victim in the master bedroom <extreme_background> 
and then i'm going to roll for fire 
so romeo five 
bravo one th- there's fire where the victim is in the smoke where the victim is in the dining room <extreme_background> 
i'm going to 
this looks like a safe spot so i'm going to leave this victim here 
okay red over <extreme_background> 
rejoin you in the master bedroom and see if we can team up to get those victims out 
%um so got to be careful fire is probably spreading in the meantime so bravo five romeo one 
there is some smoke in the small bathroom red over 
yeah %um i'm in the master bedroom with green where there is a tiny bit of fire and a little bit of smoke and two victims and 
we've got lots of fire in the game room and the kid's room and a little bit of fire has broken out into the kitchen so we're doing our best to get those victims out as soon as we can red over 
okay <background> 
i'm going to go over and find out about this victim 
it's a false alarm 
and rolling for new two yup <background> 
i think we can do it green <background> 
okay <background> 
i got one at bravo six romeo four 
uh-oh i can't have i can't have one where i just rolled so i got to roll again <background> 
that is a great idea <background>

damage to the exterior wall <background> 
bravo four romeo one

we had one victim 
%uh i don't know what i'm doing next i'm going to go into the kitchen

romeo five <background> 
okay 
%um i'm going to roll we've got a missing point of interest so i'm going to roll for that so we've got bravo six romeo four

we need to see where the victims are so at there's a victim at bravo one

romeo five another <background> 
okay alright and then fire is spreading to bravo seven 
now okay <background> 
okay <background> 
romeo four 
where there's <background> 
i think it's looking sort of well yeah maybe hit the <background> 
i got blown out 
okay red over 
yes 
i could use some backup 
it's probably a good path to take <background> 
who is breathing in my ear <background> 
okay i'm entering the living room and i'm carrying the victim oh i thought i was over there sorry so %uh mhm mhm mm mm <background> 
that master bathroom is a source of a lot of activity <background> 
one two okay so we are on top of the fire with the victim in the living room and now 
okay %uh one two i am checking one victim it's a female %um <background> 
f- <background> 
smo- yeah thank god and then fire is spreading to bravo one romeo six <background> 
the next victim i'll have to check on my next turn 
and fire is spreading to bravo seven romeo six there's already fire there 
that person's dead now <background> 
%um and so 
this smoke has turned back into fire 
and that's the game room is engulfed in flames literally 
wasn't that a point of interest <background> 
and there is more damage to the outer wall so you can actually get through there now 
and to this wall too red over 
okay i'm carrying my victim out 
we have rescued another person <background> 
and then i am going to run over to the 
dining room 
enter and ascertain 
oh good idea you could chop the wall down and get the other victim out <background> 
ascertain the identification of a false alarm 
and then the fire is spreading to bravo seven 
or let's both go that way okay <background> 
romeo five 
so there's some smoke in the small bathroom <background> 
okay <background> 
okay %uh <background> 
red over <background> 
so i'm going to i guess i'm going to head in your direction with my victim 
oh 
after 
%uh so that's t- okay 
i'm right here with you and i'm going to be able to get her out through the broken wall on the next turn <background> 
%um and so now this wall 
you can go through 
and there's fire spreading to bravo two <background> 
%um 
bravo two romeo 
three so there's some more smoke in the dining room red over <background> 
red i'm moving to the dining room 
through the dining room to see who the victim is we do have a victim so i'm going to carry her a little closer to the door and then i'm going to see where fire is spreading 
(()) 
so there's bravo three 
romeo one so we have some additional smoke 
in the %um living room red over <extreme_background> 
so can you repeat green i can't hear you okay sounds good <background> 
okay victims out 
and i'm coming back in 
and i'm going to turn one of these 
i'm going to extinguish one of those fires 
%um 
but i think that it's still spreading to bravo five romeo four 
so now there's some smoke in the hallway 
%um 
and we're short a point of interest so there's a new one at bravo one 
romeo four 
now we have a new point of interest in the fern red over 
okay 
going to help you carry this victim out 
and then i'm going to 
%uh 
run over to the living room 
you speak up green i can't hear you okay okay <background> 
turn that fire into smoke 
and then i'm going to see where else 
oh we need to %uh going to roll for a point of interest at bravo five <extreme_background> 
okay %uh i'm going to roll for two points of interest <background> 
romeo four %uh hold on bravo five 
romeo fi- oh no bravo five 
so it's one at bravo eight 
romeo two 
%um 
so we have another victim in the master bathroom then i'm going to check and see where the fire's spreading so that's bravo one <extreme_background> 
romeo three 
this is another 
point of interest in the master bedroom and then there's one more at bravo two <background> 
romeo four 
romeo six 
bravo four romeo four so now we have some smoke where that victim is red over <background> 
so there's two people %uh <background> 
oop nope no they're not 
my mistake 
so i'm going to put out two of the fires in the game room 
completely so the game room is starting to look a little bit more clearer 
and that would be it this time around red over 
yeah <background> 
red player is going over to enter the game room 
okay i'm going to go check on the other victim in the master bedroom so one two 
and it is a little kitty which i'll carry out on the next turn around 
i got to put out this fire in the game room <extreme_background> 
so fire is spreading though to bravo five romeo three 
%uh i've extinguished two 
%uh we've got an explosion in the master bathroom another one 
two of the fires they're just smoke now <extreme_background> 
you know what you've guilted me into it i'm running into the master bedroom and i'm outside the master bathroom door now so now i'm going to see where the fire is spreading it's spreading to bravo one romeo five 
maybe the doors blow off completely <background> 
so that's it red over <background> 
we got an explosion there's <extreme_background> 
okay red over <background> 
okay getting the kitty out he's safe and <background> 
okay 
i'm going into the master bath identifying the victim it's a little doggy 
that's all i can do this time around but fire is spreading to bravo six romeo one there's already a fire there there's already an explosion so it's just blown the door right off 
and i'm backing out of the master bathroom 
then going to see where the oh 
red over <extreme_background>

alright is that is that it is it red's turn <background> 
alright <background> 
this is red firefighter i am going in through the master bedroom 
%uh i've got a point of interest to the left so i'm going to go 
%uh 
i've got that's one move two 
i'm moving into the master bedroom next to the bed on the left side there's a point of interest 
flipping that over is another move correct 
so %um 
there's nobody there 
so that's my turn %um i'm going to 
do my fire check here 
we got a bravo three and a romeo one 
so that's 
is that correct 
bravo oh yeah yeah here so that would be in the living room here next to the door 
and that that makes is that create smoke then first 
and then and then since it's next to fire we've got 
more fire going on in the living room there and that's over for red 
okay i had a question but i can't remember what it is right now so i'm going to just %uh keep oh yeah you said a %uh saving 
actions for next turn that's possible 
so if i only take one then i can take seven next time <background> 
oh okay 
so this is red firefighter i'm moving back to the master bedroom 
%uh three moves to the door 
on the left side there going to the master bath 
going through the door doesn't count as a 
move does it or it does <background> 
so opening the door 
and then i just stay there 
okay and so i'm just about to enter the master bath i'm rolling 
the fire 
position we've got a bravo four 
and 
romeo six 
which is already a fire so we've got an explosion in the kitchen 
%um 
and so 
i'm spreading the fire 
adjacent to that and that i guess blows out the door 
and i put a 
damage there 
and here <background> 
but it just blows open 
%um 
do i just leave the 
yeah alright 
so that's %um red over 
which bedroom is that <background> 
uh-oh 
alright 
is that green over and out 
%um so red firefighters going to enter the master bath here 
and i've got a point of interest just ahead of me 
so i am going to advance and check it out we've got a dog there 
so 
i'm going to pick up the dog real quick here 
and that's going to be it here 
i'm going to check on the fire status 
we've got a bravo one we've got a romeo five 
so that puts %uh 
some smoke in the %uh be- in the master bath here with me 
that's red out 
red over 
did you say that you rescued the dog 
okay <extreme_background> 
okay this is red firefighter 
i'm going to take the dog out here 
i'm going to take him out just right through the door here 
oh wait it's faster to go this way so 
that was one two and then i'm going to knock a hole in the wall 
that's two more moves right 
so that's four altogether <background> 
okay 
%uh so i'm going to figure out what's going on with the fire here 
we have a bravo seven 
and romeo two 
some more smoke 
%uh it turns to fire 
in the master bedroom 
alright that's red out 
okay 
this is red firefighter i'm taking the dog out through the outside wall here 
and 
i'm going to head right back in we have rescued a dog here 
so i'm going to head back in 
and %uh open a door from the master bath to the living room 
it's safe even though there's fire there right alright so those are my moves and now i'm going to roll and see what's going on with the fire here 
we've got a bravo eight 
romeo three 
so we got some smoke starting up in the game room back there red out 
((i can't hear him at all)) <extreme_background> 
oh 
(( )) extreme_background> 
i'm not sure how he knows to place that i though he placed the fire <extreme_background> 
oh when you rescue something you have to put a new point of interest <extreme_background> 
oh i didn't do that 
i'll have to do that alright <extreme_background> 
is that a maximum <background> 
okay <background> 
this one's already known as an as a nothing but we alright so i still need to <background> 
alright so i'll go ahead and oh i'm sorry <background> 
and this one too <background> 
smoke but it's a this is a open door and it's next to fire so this will turn yep <background> 
oh yeah <background> 
oh okay so i'm just out here with the dog <background> 
alright i should know this position pretty well alright 
so 
%um that's green out right 
so red firefighter's going to re-enter through the hole in the master bath 
working through the fire here wor- going to the open door into the living room 
%um 
wait i don't there's another point of interest that i need to check out here 
so i'm going to go one two and then %uh see what this is %uh there's somebody here in the master bath 
so i'm going to pick them up and 
save one of my turns for next 
%um next round i'm going to 
roll to see where to place a new person of interest tw- we got bravo two 
romeo five 
that will put somebody over there back in the oops 
in the %um %uh there's somebody in the in- there's a point of interest in the dining room over by the kitchen table <background> 
%uh red out

this is red firefighter i'm taking this person of interest out 
two 
three four okay i've rescued somebody 
and i'm going to head back into the building now

so i'm going to roll and see where to place the new 
person of int- point of interest here we got bravo two 
and romeo four 
so we've got another 
point of interest in the living room there quite close to the dining room okay red out

alright 
%uh 
looks like green's done so red firefighter's going to check out this %uh point of interest 
in the master bath we got a cat here or something like that so i'm going to grab him and that's 
oh thank you sir 
%um so i'm going to have to sit there and 
%uh wait 
%uh yes 
so that would use up my turn actually that would be good so why don't i go ahead 
and do that that'll be faster than 
going that way so %uh i will now figure out what's going on with the fire here i got bravo one 
and romeo one 
so over here in the corner of the living room we got some more smoke 
and that's it for red red out 
green firefighter are you there i can't here you <background> 
okay <background> 
so if it's %uh alright <background> 
okay green is that it 
yeah so 
%um 
we've rescued a few people here their not all %uh i'm not sure about that 
%um we've got the kitchen and the living room almost completely engulfed 
in fire here and %uh a lot of people popping up here in the master bath are pets and things 
they've got another person i'm going to have to check out here but first i'm going to 
%uh take this cat out real quick 
there's also the kid's bedroom is %um 
totally on fire we've got a lot of structural problems over there and between the kitchen and the living room 
and a bit of fire starting up in the master bath and looks like there's probably some smoke 
%uh in the game room also 
so i'm going to take this cat outside with %uh all my moves 
%uh got another 
point of interest rescued 
so now i'm going to %uh roll to see 
so that's bravo three 
romeo three 
%uh we got another explosion here in the kitchen 
and so that's going to 
cause some fun here 
%um 
let's see 
and this fire's spread completely through the kitchen now and 
the walls are pretty much about to fall down in between 
the kitchen and the living room 
%um 
yep so %uh red over 
you're up green <background> 
(( )) 
does any fire go here <extreme_background> 
oh <extreme_background> 
okay <background> 
alright 
well we need to roll for some 
some %uh 
one point of interest we've only got one point of interest on the board at this point <background> 
oh sorry alright 
so we got bravo one and romeo six 
%um 
and that puts 
a new point of interest in the smoke in the corner 
of the dining room 
alright i'm going to do my action points here i'm going back into the master bath 
to check out this point of interest nothing's there 
%um 
so i'm going to 
%uh 
i'm not sure what a good use of my time is here maybe put out some of the fire 
in the living room 
so i'm going to head back that way 
and now i'm going to roll 
%um and so i don't need to roll for fire until told okay alright and that's red out <background> 
oh wait let me roll for another point of interest sorry <background> 
i think i need to roll for something here five bravo and romeo one 
so 
of course 
w- we can't put them in the fire roll again <background> 
alright %um we have one point of interest who is already 
%uh so we got romeo three another one in the fire here 
now we got ro- bravo five romeo five 
and so we've got another point of interest popping up in the other corner of the dining room over there next to the kid's bedroom and that is red out 
so we spend a turn to %uh reinforce walls we can do that 
for each of these 
ah okay 
yeah you could probably fix that because you still got an open door 
was that three action points <background> 
okay 
why was that four 
oh that's two <background> 
okay

i'm going to move here 
and i'm going to extinguish 
we've got %uh 
three action points %uh one in the master bath one in the master bedroom one in the living room the red firefighter is helping get out of here i think our next move should be to try to put out

%uh 
the fire in the master bath and help that person out %um

to use one to get

out of the house 
%um 
and then 
oh no wait 
mm 
actually alright i'm going to reassess here

alright 
i'm going to flip this we got another person here 
i'm going to move back here and then i'm going to go to there 
i'm going to use one action point here to extinguish this smoke

bravo two 
romeo four 
it looks like there's some smoke in the living room again over 
great i'm going to move into the master bedroom there is a ~POI in the master bath that i am going to try to get to 
i can not momentarily but will shortly 
there is 
fire spreading at bravo three romeo five so there's some smoke in the dining room where you are i would be careful over 
good thank you for that update i am seeing if this is a person of interest it is a false alarm but there is smoke that i'm going to extinguish in the master bath 
and i am going to make my way out to get this person of interest that is in the small bathroom 
over 
oh dear %uh i will try to work on putting that out later on but i'm going to see who this point of interest is it is a dog and i will take them outside to safety 
and soon try to make some 
fire disappear in the living room i believe there's some more fire 
at bravo three romeo two 
which is another explosion again in the living room the living room does not look good at this point and time 
that should be something that we looks at 
in the near future over <background> 
great %um i'm going to look at this person of interest that is in the master bedroom 
looks like it is a false alarm but i believe there is another point of interest at bravo seven 
romeo four which is the game room so there is a person of interest in the game room at this time i'll make my way out to try to put out some more fire in the living room 
i believe we have some more fire spreading first 
%uh there's fire spreading at bravo five 
romeo one so there's fi- there's some smoke in the master bath at this time over 
i'm going to put some of the fire out that's in the living room 
i'm trying to extinguish some but i can't do it all but some is out in the living room at this time 
and there's some more fire spreading 
at bravo one romeo three 
which is a problem because 
that's going to just be spreading in the living room as well over 
great i'm going to make myself 
%uh out of the living room to safety 
and i'm going to get this person of interest that's in the dining room 
and it is a person and i will bring them to safety 
and we'll check on the person in the small bathroom later on 
there is a person of interest at 
bravo five romeo three my mistake let me see that again 
it looks like 
possibly bravo 
one that is also incorrect 
we have a person of interest at 
it looks like bravo four romeo five so there's a person of interest 
in the dining room as well so we now have a person of interest in the dining room small bathroom and you're taking one out 
and in terms of fire i believe that's spreading at 
bravo eight romeo two ((so there's some)) smoke currently in the master bathroom bedroom over 
thank you for that update %um i'm going to make my way into the dining room to try to see who this person of interest is 
it looks like it's a person i will make my way out of the dining room so i can bring them to safety 
there is 
fire some smoke at bravo one romeo three which is now and explosion 
and that's going to 
take %um open the door of the living room and cause some damage to the wall to the living room i think the living room is cause for concern the fire is spreading rapidly through everywhere there 
%uh over 
oh dear that's really bad news i am going to try to get the smoke out that is in the dining room with me so it won't be a cause for concern and try to move my person out as quickly as possible 
there is some more smoke spreading at bravo three romeo five so smoke right in the dining room area 
i will get the 
person out as soon as possible over 
great thank you i'm going to take this person of interest outside of the dining room they are now safely 
outside 
i will help you with the living room to extinguish that fire as soon as possible 
we do have some more fire spreading at bravo six romeo three 
so there is now more fire in the kitchen it looks like the doors are closed so hopefully it won't spread into the game room at this time over 
okay what would you recommend should i go for the person of interest that's in the game room or help extinguish fire in the living room <background> 
okay you got it so i'll make my way over to the game room <background> 
%uh i cannot get the person of interest at this time but i will shortly it looks like there is some more fire smoke spreading at bravo five romeo six so there is some more smoke that is occurring in the dining room at this time there is a person of interest in there so we should get them out 
when can 
over 
okay i'm going to get this person in the game room and see if it's a person it is a cat 
i'm going to make my way out of the game room 
i will have to do that a little bit later 
at this time 
there is some more smoke spreading at 
bravo three romeo six so that's right where you are in the dining room there is some smoke so be careful in there over 
great i'm going to get this person out of the game room to safety the cat is to safety 
and i'm going to make my way over to the dining room where you are to help get this other person of interest 
there is another person of interest 
at bravo 
looks like bravo two 
romeo five so that's also in the dining room which is very convenient so now there's three points of interest in the dining room over 
great thank you for the update i am going to make my way into the dining room 
taking out some smoke as i go in i cannot check to see who this person of interest is quite yet but i can take out some more smoke 
and there is some more smoke spreading at 
bravo one 
%uh romeo five so more smoke where we are in the dining room we'll have to be careful of that over 
okay i'm going to get this person of interest and see if they're here it is a dog i'm going to put out the fire that is in front of us to try to make that die down and the dining room i will take the dog out 
of the building as soon as possible there is 
some more fire spreading at bravo eight romeo one so there's some smoke right under that point of person of interest in the master bedroom if we could get to them as quickly as possible that would be great over 
i'm going to take this person 
try to take them to safety i cannot at this time 
but will do that shortly over 
excellent i'm taking this person this this dog to safety they are safe 
i will go back in to retrieve the person of interest that is in the dining room still over 
there is another ~POI at 
bravo two 
my mistake that is 
bravo five 
romeo 
six 
so there is another 
person of interest in the dining room at this time over 
great i'm also going to see if this is a potential 
person of interest in the dining room it is it is a man i will take him out to +safety when i can 
there is still some smoke in the dining room and like we've said the living room is completely almost engulfed with fire as well as the kitchen and master bedroom 
master bath so be careful over 
great i'm trying to move this person of interest man outside as quickly as possible 
i can (( )) pretty close to the door in the living in the dining room but i can not get them completely outside 
i will try to do that 
quickly over 
thank you for the update i am safely bringing this man outside of the dining room to safety he is safe i'm returning back into the dining room to look for this person of interest 
%um i cannot extinguish any fire anything at this time but i will when i get a chance 
there is fire spreading at 
looks like bravo five romeo five so that is now fire in the dining room i will try to get this person of interest out as quickly as i can over

and i'm going to save 
this point of interest as my next step 
and %uh 
roll roll for fire okay well actually wait <background> 
and we are at bravo 
seven romeo six 
and the fire has spread to the kid's bedroom there's smoke there and %uh over 
it's my turn oh it's my turn does %uh does going on to a point of interest use an action point <background> 
okay oh okay <background> 
so we're moving the smoke out of the kitchen 
so i am going to move twice 
here into the living room 
is this act good idea 
and %uh 
roll for fire 
this is %uh well actually what happens if it's a false a <background> 
so we are at bravo five 
romeo five and 
i'm sorry oh okay <background> 
there is 
smoke in the dining room 
%um 
and 
over 
right <background> 
mm 
%uh ooh okay 
okay 
wonderful +okay <background> 
((wait)) a point of interest here 
and 
rolling %uh to see where smoke has spread yes okay 
and so where the smoke has spread to 
bravo 
three 
romeo six 
and %um it's in this general area <background> 
oh <background> 
yes yes <background> 
so i am going to save this 
oh +okay <background> 
point of interest here 
okay 
now roll for a new point of interest 
oh +okay got it alright over <background> 
we are at %uh romeo six 
i'm sorry i'm <background> 
bravo four 
and so 
this is ((%uh)) this romeo four oh okay <background> 
oh okay here 
that what okay 
and 
%um <background> 
i'm going to ext- 
extinguish this 
these smokes 
for two action points 
extinguish one 
okay <background> 
and %uh reenter here 
and over and roll for fire 
okay <background> 
so we are at 
bravo four 
romeo four 
okay 
so there is smoke in the kitchen 
now over 
i am 
there is a man here 
%uh would you am i able to 
save this 
person 
i'm sorry y- <background> 
%uh okay 
okay 
%um 
right right <background> 
so romeo five 
alright 
so i don't need to roll because we have fire right so i'm going to use my four points let me get these aside <background> 
actually one two 
three four 
i am going to 
enter through the game room to get to a point of interest that is in the small bathroom 
so i'm using one 
two there's a wall there's a wall got it <background> 
got it got it got it got it got it g- 
yeah 
it's very true 
so then-- <background> 
so then <background> 
%uh the dilemma is 
who do i save first i think the easiest save is probably 
in the dining room 
so i'm going to use 
one 
two 
three four points to just get to the person 
in the dining room 
and that's 
my shot over i'm going to roll for 
more fire 
we've got 
three bravo we've got three romeo 
so we're looking at three 
and three so we have an explosion already isn't that - isn't that great isn't that awesome three and three explosion <background> 
right so i think that this wall <background> 
this door rather is damaged is completely open <background> 
okay got you got you got you so it's completely blown open <background> 
%um 
i would say maybe a fire here <background> 
alright <background> 
okay got you 
right so that means we have %uh <background> 
maybe we have damage here on the wall 
it's already open that means that the fire's gone through here which means maybe it means it's gone this far <background> 
okay so we have damage here <background> 
mm that means that it would go further into the kitchen <background> 
%uh we just had a fire that extended <background> 
%uh the kitchen fire is +is we have a little bit in the living room but we have a a major extension in the actual kitchen 
%um 
we have fire we have wall damage between the kitchen and the living room 
i 
want to say that there's even more fire damage okay alright <background> 
so over 
one shot <background> 
open the door is a ((third))  
mhm <background> 
copy that <background> 
alright we got an explosion no <background>

it looks like things aren't too bad right now just taking a moment strategize 
learn from 
yeah that's what i'm thinking like let's go i'm going to go towards the kitchen i think i'm going to start over here i'm going to use 
an action to get inside i'm going to use an action to turn this to ((smoke))  
an action to get here and an action 
%um to open this door 
and then 
i'm done and i'm going to roll and see if the fire is spreading 
we got romeo six 
bravo 
one 
romeo six alright so we got some smoke in the dining room nothing too scary but there's potentially a person in there so 
over to you <background> 
thank you 
alright great i'm going to use an action to turn this fire to smoke 
i'm going to use an action to get in there %um 
i'm going to turn this fire to smoke also 
and 
i am going 
to go right here 
%um and now i'm rolling for fire so we got romeo five 
bravo six romeo five 
oh shoot 
explosion in the kid's bedroom <background>

oh okay great alright over to you blue <background>

knocking down this wall 
in such a way that i can walk through it so that's all my action right there

see who this is it's a dog oh my god 
alright me and this dog are 
do you think i should try and go through the living room and put out the fire as i'm going or should i just try 
and get through the master bedroom with the dog safely 
is it worth jeopardizing this dog's life 
i don't know (())  <background> 
%um 
well it's part of our strategy alright 
alright <background> 
%um yeah that's a good idea r- okay so me and the dog are going back 
into the kitchen 
enough back into the inferno <background> 
i'm going to roll for fire now got bravo three romeo two 
oh shoot 
no 
that happened alright over to you blue 
i'm going to use two actions to turn both of these into smoke 
and then me and the puppy are walking closer to the door 
and now i'm rolling for fire i got bravo seven romeo one oh so we got some more smoke in the master bedroom 
alright over <background> 
oh fuck <background> 
but it's still that potential victim in the small bathroom 
frick <background> 
i'm i'm just going to use all my action to get this dog closer to the door <background> 
%um 
so rolling for fire i got bravo three 
romeo five 
alright we got some more smoke happening in the dining room over to you blue

maybe someone in the game room %um i'm going to come through <background> 
((i have)) 
%uh <background> 
we can't just save people alright we got six and six 
ah <background> 
gosh there could be someone in the kid's bedroom

i'm using two points to start knocking down this wall 
no wait 
no i'm just going to in here and see who this is oh it's a dude alright i'm rolling for fire 
all this smoke i got bravo four romeo three 
oh god 
over to you blue <background> 
alright i'm going to use %uh one action to put one hole in this wall and then another action <background> 
%uh thanks i'm using two actions to put a hole in the wall 
i'm going to use one action to take a peep who this is oh good thing i did that because it's no one copy that there is no one in the small bathroom i'm going to save one of my actions for my next turn

alright i'm getting this dude out of here he's out 
%um 
i guess i have to roll to see if there's anyone else in the house got bravo four romeo 
one which means there could potentially be someone in the master bath luckily got no smoke or fire in there at the moment 
%um i guess we got to get to the kid's room 
%um alright well there's already this hole in the wall from the explosion so i'm just going to make the hole a little bit bigger 
using two action points and then i'm going to use my last action point to see who it is oh god it is a person 
%um alright i'm going to roll for fire we got bravo five romeo two 
alright it's getting smoky now in the master bathroom so i hope whoever's in there 
is okay <background>

romeo three 
oh god it's starting to get smoky in the game room <background> 
yeah i'm thinking i'm thinking sorry i'm thinking dude okay i'm thinking would it be better for me to try and put a hole in the wall to see who that other victim is <background>

(()) 
which one the master bedroom <background> 
and put out fire or should i be going into the living room and start putting out the fire from there <background> 
okay cool yeah i'm going to do that so %uh one to enter the living room

this one to smoke 
%um cool alright ((it's)) rolling for more fire i got bravo four

%uh one to get in there 
oh my goodness i understand copy that okay so moving out i am now i have exited the dining room we've rescued one person this is great <background> 
and then i can use 
%uh one remaining action point to %uh turn this 
fire to smoke okay %uh over 
i'm going to look scan for additional ~POIS 
oh d- and i d- and i nee- i'm sorry i just need to check to see if there's any more fire

it turns out there's a a person here 
i'm going to move two spaces towards the small bathroom 
%uh door and i'm going to extinguish smoke 
ahead of me

oh okay great thank you 
goes two directions here 
%uh damage to the interior of the house 
continuing this way it blows the door open <background>

excellent <background> 
over 
uh-oh copy that alright i'm now headed out the door here %uh one <background> 
oh <background> 
and then two almost out of the mas- %uh almost out of the kid's bedroom checking now for fire sign finding fire sign at romeo six

two and i'm going to %uh examine this point of interest that we just uncovered and i found a person 
i'm going to %uh have to ho- bank a b- %uh an action point here so i'm going to check for %uh fire indicators

%uh copy copy that blue firefighter 
checking for fire sign and finding fire sign at romeo three 
i think i'm going to try to head to that living room and put out a little bit of the fire and see if i can't get to that point of interest %uh in the corner there so %uh l- let's see i'm going to go 
bravo three %uh so that appears to be an additional explosion 
in the kitchen %um so let's see %uh first of all there's an explosion blows out this wall 
one 
oh this door is open of course th- control that's excellent thank you for that %uh that that good eye alright so instead i'm going to put out the fire that's directly in front of me <background> 
%uh blows out this wall 
%uh and it %uh spreads fire into further into the living room now blocking your exit sorry about that blue firefighter 
and i'm going to move one 
and i'm going to turn this last one into smoke to try to make some progress toward the %uh the the the the possible person of interest there %uh point of interest 
and it looks like there's been some additional fire signs at romeo two bravo three oh no more explosions everywhere %uh boom so another damage to the 
door here that was romeo two bravo three 
%um damage to the exterior walls 
%uh damage to the wall leading into the kitchen 
roger copy that alright so %uh i'm first of all going to check my point of interest finding %uh an adorable little kitten %uh i'm now going to grab that kitten and start moving out of the dining room <background>

two bravo three romeo two bravo three romeo two bravo three that is a a flame marked spot in the living room there is a point of interest there and %uh i think that was all of my points so i'm going to check for fire now

%uh i'm seeing a fire sign at 
romeo two bravo six that's smoke in the master bedroom smoke in the master bedroom over 
okay %uh understood %uh so i'm moving out of the the building person saved %uh now let's see i guess i could try to get back to that master bath to see the oh but i better see if there are any other points of interest in here you're absolutely right <background> 
absolutely %uh it appears there is significant fire in the living room in the kitchen master bedroom and kid's bedroom there is a little bit of fire in the game room and there's some smoke in the dining room small bathroom and master bedroom over <background> 
%uh and th- th- th- there is a point of interest at romeo four bravo five oh no it's just really terrible in the in the burning kitchen 
alright i'm going to make a beeline for that kitchen so i'm going to go one and i'm going to turn this to smoke and that'll be my my my turn over 
oh no <background> 
%uh i'm not if you have if you have a suggestion %uh i will take it but <background> 
through the game room i've already taken my turn you're right sorry %uh no problem i can %uh i'll i'll i'll see if there's an easier way to get there <background> 
i'll take your take your advice next turn go ahead <background>

also in the that same kitchen <background> 
%uh bravo five which is the room i just left it is the dining room it is now on fire over

okay i yield to your sus- %uh superior experience blue firefighter i'm going to go ahead and turn this into nothing i'm going to move one <background> 
uh-oh <background> 
sorry 
and then i'm going to extinguish this fire as well to try to %uh get to one of these two points of interest here and then maybe i'll search the master bath over 
copy that 
okay so i'm going to turn one fire into smoke i'm going to move into that smoke i'm going to turn an additional fire into smoke and i'm going to move into that so i can check the point of interest next turn now checking for fire sign and finding 
sounds good blue firefighter alright so i'm moving into the kitchen this this this %uh this hellscape of %uh of of fire and flame %uh and i'm going to try to extinguish this then i'm going to move close i ought to be able to reach that point of interest by my next move <background>

and then one to move in and then o- one final one to turn that smoke that flame into smoke 
over <background> 
copy that

oh understood alright so i am going to 
explosion rocks the exterior wall 
the master bedroom wall 
blows open the door 
exit the building with my person over 
%uh and blows flames all the way down into the dining room which then ignites the dining room in a huge conflagration truly spectacular in the power of nature flame it's it's a primordial force that we are powerless to resist over <background> 
i'm sorry not over i apologize i have two movement points remaining 
%uh let me %uh see if there are any other points of interest 
there appears to be a point of interest at romeo one 
%uh bravo seven oh no a person in the flames this is terrible %um 
%uh i also have a person right next to me blue firefighter in the dining room should i dash %uh dash back into the dining room or should i prioritize the person in the master bedroom d- <background> 
no no need <background> 
okay copy that i'm now moving out of the room with one additional person saved checking for other ~POI finding a ~POI at romeo two bravo four romeo two bravo four that's a person in the master bath here on fire <background> 
sure strike while the the potential flame victim is hot <background> 
okay %uh so i'm going to go back in here and %uh try to grab the the living room victim okay %uh checking for fire spread <background> 
it appears that there's some fire spreading at romeo four 
%uh i'm going to head towards that mater bath i guess 
bravo six so that's a fire there in the kitchen again over <background> 
so one 
and then i'm going to turn the smoke into f- %uh fire into smoke over 
w- where i'm i'm standing on them alright i guess i'll check them first then <background> 
oh no <background> 
absolutely <background> 
well done alright i'm checking the ~POI i'm standing on it is a person i'm moving right back out of the building person saved 
well done <background> 
%uh okay i'm going to check for additional ~POIS 
finding an additional ~POI %uh at romeo four bravo three romeo four bravo three that's in the kitchen 
oh <background> 
copy that 
alright so i'm going to move over here i'm going to see what 
alright i have two additional points so i'm going to head right back in to the master bath 
going on there is in fact a person here and i'm going to head towards the exit with them 
i'm now in the master bath over 
%uh that's the end of my turn now i'm going to see if there's any additional fire spread it looks like there's fire spreading at location romeo five 
oh no <background> 
bravo six there was already fire at romeo five bravo six so i think we have an explosion 
heading this way 
heading this way 
heading this way 
and also finally %uh that's a lot of structural damage to the kid's bedroom they're definitely going to have to get an insurance adjuster in here over <background> 
s- sounds good okay so i'm going to use one action point to turn this %uh flame into smoke 
i'm going to move into this spot with my another one and i'm going to check 
there is a person here with my one remaining action point i'm going to clear the smoke in front of me over 
oh phew 
headphones on <background> 
yeah you need to do a mic check or anything or <background> 
okay <background> 
okay cool alright <background> 
(()) got a door right there <background> 
hey when you got a fire ax everything looks like a wall you know it's like <background> 
okay i'm going to enter into the master bedroom 
it's one point move towards the door open the door 
and then move on into the master bath <background> 
okay i guess i'm going to enter through 
i'm going to roll for fire 
the master bedroom 
that's %uh 
let's see move one space open this door 
three romeo and eight bravo 
and enter into the master bath 
okay 
s- 
alright i'm going to enter through the dining room door (()) <background> 
and i think that's all four points i'm going to roll for fire i got %uh six romeo 
and over 
actually that probably would be more efficient <background> 
and %uh six bravo so that's right there uh-oh an explosion right off the bat so we got fire in the kid's bedroom this door blows open i think <background> 
alright 
it's %uh it's a *jake right 
some damage to the walls 
we we looked up this firefighting slang yesterday okay a *jake is a a *jake is a lousy firefighter <background> 
okay over yup over <background> 
oh cool yeah thank you 
alright so %uh 
i was too involved <background> 
let's see %uh i'm going to use my two more points to 
move towards the fire inside the dining room and i'm going to reduce it to smoke and i think that wraps me up 
okay 
i'm going to spend 
so i'm going to roll for fire placement 
one point to 
%uh five for romeo and %uh six for bravo 
move this tile and one to flip 
the point of interest and then m- one more 
so that is 
%er well two points to move one tile and i'm going to roll for fire <background> 
in the kid's bedroom 
looks like smoke is developing in the kid's bedroom <background> 
i got a three for romeo and a seven for bravo 
okay going to flip this ~POI 
so that's 
check check <background> 
going to move onto this space pick them up 
in the game room (()) 
fire breaking out or smoke in the game room okay over <background> 
and move out 
okay 
okay red it's all you over <background> 
mm oh right 
yeah so romeo one 
and bravo seven 
so there's smoke in the master bedroom 
okay 
going to put out that smoke with one action point 
and i'm 
spending two more points to move into the master bedroom from the master bath 
%uh i have one point left i'm going to save that for next time and i'm going to roll for fire <background> 
that's %uh one 
for romeo and %uh two for bravo 
mm-hm <background> 
okay i'm going to march on into the smoke and eliminate it 
oh man another explosion in the living room 
a- oh <background> 
and 
then i'm going to use my remaining two points to eliminate the fire in the --the living room hallway 
yep <background> 
you got it <background> 
so i'm rolling for fire placement i got a one for romeo and a one for bravo so that is over here 
looks like smoke is breaking out in the living room 
okay 
over <background> 
i'm going to move into the master bedroom and then move one more step closer to the door 
and that's my four points so i'm going to roll for fire oh did we roll f- oh no never mind 
we got a two romeo and a eight bravo so that is 
there we go more smoke in the master bedroom 
okay <background> 
okay 
let's see i am going to move towards the ~POI in the living room 
that's %uh two movements 
it's a human being and with my last action point i'm going to move towards 
the living room wall 
and you know what i got planned next turn placing fire 
got a three for romeo and a six for bravo 
that is 
sounds good <background> 
some smo- does that count as an adjacent 
like diagonally okay so that's just smoke <background> 
spreading inside the master bedroom <background> 
yeah <background> 
some hot air <background> 
okay 
let's see i'm going to spend the first point to eliminate the smoke 
okay i'm going to use my four points to carry 
i'm going to spend two more points to carry the 
this humble human outside 
~POI outside 
%uh that saves him and then i am going to 
and i think that's going to be it for my turn i'm going to save that one point for next time 
probably should make my way towards the center 
%um see rolling for fire that's six romeo and six bravo 
okay i'm going to use all four points to bash a hole in the wall of the living room 
kitchen area 
i wonder i think i'm going to enter with my one remaining point from the previous turn <background> 
so %uh 
right here we have 
and i'll roll for fire placement 
through this doorway 
and 
an explosion in the kid's bedroom so that's going to blast open this door oh was it okay <background> 
that's a three for romeo and a six for bravo 
now i'm going to roll for fire

patient out %er the person out through the %uh the hole in the wall 
over 
alright rolling for ~POI placement i got a romeo one and

fire placement 
that's %uh one for romeo and 
yeah they were yep okay <background> 
two for bravo 
nice so there's some more smoke in the living room <background> 
okay 
o- oh ~POI placement yeah <background>

nice <background> 
i'm going to roll for a new ~POI i got romeo six and bravo six okay <background> 
i'm rolling for fire 
i've got a three for romeo and a five for bravo 
that is 
looks like it turns out there is actually another child in the kid's bedroom 
back in the kitchen 
another explosion in the kitchen 
they were probably hiding underneath the bed 
and some wall damage 
okay 
while the firefighters were coming through 
%um i think i'm going to end enter in through the dining room 
alright <background> 
it's very dangerous they shouldn't do that 
oh okay <background> 
%um and move towards the ~POI 
well no i'm going to reduce some of this get rid of the two smoke tokens 
%uh and then move one more unit <background> 
actually i'm going to keep my distance while i'm out there just hang on to that one 
oh hold up green <background> 
action point for next turn so i'm rolling for fire placement 
would you be able to do this one instead so i can pick up that one carry them both out 
got a six for romeo 
oh okay <background> 
and a six for bravo so that's (()) right there 
some more smoke in the kid's bedroom 
understood <background> 
over 
okay 
oh <background> 
so i'm going to enter in through the living room door 
okay 
and i am going to 
i'm going to spend 
spend the next three points reducing these flames to smoke 
one point two points to move one tile 
i'm going to put a hole 
and oh i'm inside the living room at 
in that wall 
%uh bravo three %uh romeo %er 
and i think that leaves me with one point for next turn <background> 
okay %um i'm going to move towards oh right yeah <background> 
romeo three bravo one and i was eliminating the adjacent fire 
oh well it's only doing one damage because you already did one 
okay 
and now i'm going to roll for fire placement and i got a 
no <background> 
six for romeo and a six for bravo 
oh its it okay alright in that case i'm done for that turn <background> 
okay 
i'm going to move towards the ~POI 
%um and <background> 
s- 
using two action points i'm going to reduce the smoke 
yeah i'm going to roll for fire 
so we have some more smoke in the kid's bedroom 
i got a two for romeo 
and move onto the ~POI tile right outside the kitchen door and it looks like it's a young person 
and a five for bravo 
(()) 
alright we got smoke in the master bath 
and that wraps up my turn 
i'm going to roll for fire placement 
i got a six for romeo 
and a one for bravo so we have some more smoke in the kitchen 
i don't think so no yeah <background> 
i see okay <background> 
in that case i am going to 
eliminate these two smoke tokens inside the living room that's at romeo four bravo one and romeo three bravo two 
okay i'm going to make my way towards the exit in the kitchen 
i'm going to move on over into this into %uh romeo three bravo two flip the token <background> 
that's two mov- well <background> 
one i'm going to move 
and i'm going to hang onto the two action points for next turn 
sounds good i'm going to carry this innocent out 
and i think i don't have enough to pick them up 
rolling for <background> 
going to reenter going to flip over this point of interest and it looks like it's another person 
or move so i'm just going to leave it at that with 
fire placement i got a four for romeo and a six for bravo 
one action point left over 
i think that uses up my points so i'm going to roll for fire i got a romeo three and a bravo two <background> 
%um and i'm going to roll for fire placement 
which god dang okay there is an explosion inside the hallway 
i've got a one for romeo and one for bravo 
it's spreading into the kid's bedroom 
that's 
and that is more fire in the living room it's spreading <background> 
some smoke in the living room and then the roll for another point of interest that makes a romeo four and a bravo seven 
it is spread into the game room down the hallway and 
good point alright so we got a one for romeo 
into the master bedroom 
so that's going to be 
and a one for bravo also 
and i think 
there we go <background> 
that wraps up my turn <background> 
over <background> 
sounds good <background> 
okay <background> 
okay 
see i'm going to 
hm i'm going to spend two points to remove this fire 
okay 
i'm going to carry this point of interest out i'm going to use another point to enter here and then another to 
and then another two points to move 
okay i'm going to head towards the exit with my 
a step towards the door of the living room 
~POI i have 
exited the building through the kitchen 
so i'm going to roll for fire placement 
get to this point of interest 
and i'm going to roll for fire placement 
i got a two for romeo 
%um <background> 
and a three for bravo 
oh wait i still have two more points from the previous turn so i'm going to use 
oh that's an explosion 
sure we have a 
hole in the small bathroom with an exterior load bearing wall 
two of those points to put a ho- 
so we've got some damage to the wall between the kitchen and the living room 
complete the hole that the fire began inside the kid's bedroom wall 
the interior wall to the kid's bedroom is severely damaged and it looks like much of the master bath 
one firefighter is down 
and oh and the fire is spreading 
so i'm rolling for ~POI placement i've got a three for romeo and a seven for bravo <background> 
interior walls have been destroyed there's also some minor damage in the dining room 
okay 
over <background> 
yup 
and that puts me 
alright i'm going to roll for fire i got %uh two romeo 
right next to you red 
now for fire placement 
and %uh one bravo 
alright <background> 
got a three for romeo 
and a five 
so that counts as smoke in the master bath 
okay over 
oh <background> 
yeah they're wasted <background> 
i think it stays yeah <background> 
oh right <background> 
okay so i'm carrying this 
%uh person out and 
shoot 
okay i am going to see if i can deal with some of the fire in this %uh kid's bedroom 
yeah <background> 
how about this smoke here no <background> 
%um i'm also wondering are we listening to ((wood being sawn)) or somebody hyperventilating <background> 
yeah i'm not sure how that's going to work but sure what were you thinking 
okay i don't know alright <background> 
okay so i'm flipping over this point of interest it's okay 
okay <background> 
alright okay well odd sounding fire anyway <background> 
returning back into the living room towards the kitchen and the master bath 
%um 
spending two points to carry them out and 
yeah 
and i'm going to roll for fire placement 
got a four for romeo and a two for bravo that's 
yeah right contractor noises alright so %um 
oh actually before that i'm going to put out this smoke with one point and then two points to carry them in the direction of the exit 
%uh ch- 
entering in oh eliminated the fire in the kid's bedroom 
right here 
so the fire is still going strong in the living room and over 
i'm going to roll for fire 
and 
i got a five for romeo and a one for bravo 
i think i'm going to hang out outside for the time being %um 
don't worry about the smoke though just %uh yeah <background> 
and that leaves me with 
which mean- that's 
two points 
for next turn 
okay we have fire breaking out in the dining room <background> 
%um and i'm going to roll for fire placement 
oh what if you just r- yeah <background> 
got a one for romeo 
and a one for bravo

i think so that's what i was planning on doing do you have another course of action you'd like to suggest sound good <background> 
romeo five right there 
i'm going to spend two points to get this person outside and then i think i'm going to 
yeah <background> 
okay <background> 
alright i'm going to make that so and moving on in through the hole into the kid's bedroom and reducing three of these fires to smoke 
okay <background> 
enter through the living room door 
yeah i guess i'm just going to continue with the plan and head on towards the master bathroom %um 
that's a third point so i'm going to spend my last point to <background> 
((then)) i'm going to roll for fire placement 
flip this to smoke 
oh it turns out it was a fools errand all along <background> 
%um <background> 
got three for romeo

and 
four for bravo

so that is <background> 
okay 
%uh no we got there's two on this ((aisle))  <background>

yeah she's %uh carrying one on out and yeah <background> 
yeah that that was hyperventilating we were hearing earlier <background> 
and i'm going to reduce this fire to smoke 
in the living room 
and that's over you're turn <background> 
(()) can i just use one action point to kill her and then she respawns outside does that work oh darn alright <background> 
okay 
was that ~POI placement or a fire placement you just did <background> 
okay <background> 
that's okay <background> 
okay <background> 
no *prob 
okay 
%um i'm going to move one unit towards 
there's another house that's on more on fire than this one somewhere in this city 
the door to the hallway 
and i'm going to i think i'm going to eliminate this smoke here 
alright i'm moving one point there reducing %er eliminating these two smoke tokens i'm reducing this fire to smoke and that's four points for me 
oh my god <background> 
my three more two more points and with my last point i'm going to move towards the door 
okay 
%uh do you think you have this under control in the game room red player yeah sounds good %uh i'm going to move on into <background> 
and yeah i'm going to roll for fire placement 
rolling for fire i got a one for romeo and a four for bravo

it's %uh yeah some more smoke in the master bedroom 
okay <background> 
i'm going to eliminate this smoke 
through the doorway and then i'm going to retreat 
towards the living room exit so that's let's see that was one two points three so i have one point remaining 
i'm going to 
enter into the dining room and i'm going to roll for fire i got a two for romeo and a four for bravo

okay well we have %uh fire throughout the kitchen there's fire breaking out inside the dining room there is smoke 
and a one for bravo 
i'm going to 
eliminate this fire with two more points and then i'm going to <background> 
move onto the token with the ~POI

i use two to move here and then just to make it easier i'll get rid of the smoke here 
like you should look at that guy f- instead of moving him here i think you should look at this guy first 
%uh and the fire has spread to 
bravo three romeo one so now there's more fire going here in the living room over 
i think you should wait well just wait or maybe not wait can you carry two people at once %uh <background>

what is this right here is that an open door oh oh oops %um <background> 
and the fire spreads to 
bravo eight romeo two

of my action points to 
so 
i take 
%um 
two to move here 
to destroy this wall here so now there's a hole here in the wall and on my next turn i will go through and save this person 
and two to move here 
%uh 
over <background> 
%um 
meanwhile the fire has spread to 
bravo six romeo five 
so it's yet another explosion 
so now there is damage to this wall 
damage to this wall 
%uh so all three walls here have h- there's h- three different holes in the wall here 
okay %uh <background> 
and now there's damage to this wall as well %uh 
i am just going to 
move two times with this person so now i'm right by the door there's %uh nothing else i have to do over 
no the kid's bedroom is <background> 
the epicenter of the fire over 
okay <background> 
%uh okay i moved this person out of the house 
%uh 
so we need a new action 
i mean we need a new point of interest 
there's a new point of interest at bravo six romeo three 
there's a new point of interest here in the kitchen 
%um 
i will get there and the fastest way to get there is to break down this door 
so i'll spend my remaining two to go here and here 
so i'm there 
%uh over 
okay 
i 
%uh open the door 
then i walk through it 
then i move here 
and then i turn over the action point to see that it's a woman so there's another person in the house that we have to safe 
%um 
%uh 
and then we have to see where the fire spreads right because the --oh there's okay great so %uh over <background> 
that's right where i am 
oh no it's not sorry 
okay so i've used my first action point to move into the small bathroom here 
oh wow <background> 
then i turn over 
the person it's a cat %um <background> 
yeah that's right where you are 
and then i use my remaining two action points to move the cat out of the house 
%um 
%uh so we need a new point of interest 
%um so 
%uh the new point of interest is at bravo one romeo four 
%um so that's just 
oh no no %um 
so that's right next to where you are that's really easy and convenient 
%um 
and then the fire has spread to 
okay so 
%um the fire has spread to bravo seven romeo four so that just puts more smoke in the game room which is where this other person is 
i use 
two action points to move here and another two to get here %uh 
but that's not too bad 
are we still in the 
%uh over <background> 
okay over <background> 
okay 
%uh 
so i will just use two to move here and two to leave the house so i saved this person 
%um 
%uh 
okay we need a new point of interest 
there's a new point of interest at bravo two romeo six so there's a new person here 
%uh 
so 
%um clearly what i should do is check on these people here 
i guess the easiest thing for me to do is to get this person here so i do 
but i'm out of turn i'm out of action points 
first i'll make this go away 
%uh but i'll do that on my next turn okay %uh 
and then one or two three four turn it over 
the fire is spreading to bravo four romeo five 
it's this guy again in the jacket and tie 
%uh 
and the fire has spread to 
okay there's smoke here in the dining room but it's not a big deal over 
bravo two romeo five 
%uh so that's just more smoke here in the dining room 
over 
yeah <background> 
okay %uh 
so %uh first i enter here 
then i go here then i check on this person and it's a cat 
%um 
i would rather save a person than a cat so i would check this one %uh so i move here and i abandoned the little cat here 
%uh 
%uh the fire spreads to 
okay 
%uh so i use all four of my action points to get this person out of the house 
bravo five romeo six so %uh there's just some more smoke right here that's not a big deal 
%uh 
%uh over <background> 
so a new point of interest falls at 
bravo two romeo one right here in the living room 
%um 
and the fire has advanced 
at bravo seven romeo five 
as yet another explosion in the same room so 
in this direction there is 
a hole in the wall in this direction the fire goes straight through and now there's fire here 
in this direction there's damage to this wall and in this direction there's damage to this wall 
there's been so much fire here in this particular room 
%uh fortunately there are no people there 
%uh 
over 
okay first i move here 
then i turn over this 
and see that's a woman 
%uh and i use my remaining two to 
move here 
%um 
%uh 
and the fire spreads to 
bravo three romeo one oh there's an explosion 
this door's open 
i guess there's fire here wow <background> 
%uh 
damage to this wall 
and damage to this wall that was a lot 
%uh <background> 
over 
okay 
%uh we got to get the person out of this dangerous room so 
%um 
i will enter h- oh 
i will enter here one or first i turn it to smoke then i enter then i turn this to smoke 
okay 
then i enter unfortunately i am out of action points so 
i just used two move here and two to move here so that's my whole turn 
i wish i could turn over that person but i'm out of action points 
%uh 
so we need a new point of interest 
%uh and the fire spreads to 
bravo eight romeo two so that's just more fire in the master bedroom over 
oh oh you're right 
i forgot okay never mind okay so the okay the fire has spread to 
bravo two romeo four 
%uh there's an explosion

oh <background> 
so it's probably easier to just walk or 
i don't know <background> 
the kid's bedroom it's going to 
punch a couple holes in the wall and %um 
blow open the door but i think that's about all i can do 
%uh alright over

i guess turn this to smoke as well %um 
yeah 
i'm going to roll for 
nice

so we got a ~POI in the dining room %um and now i'm going to roll for fire bravo 
okay <background> 
%uh where's the nearest door 
hm 
i'm thinking i may go in through the game room

i think i'm going to go into the dining room 
%uh ((looks like over here))  okay %uh ((reassessing)) this fire 
so that's 
that door's open so it'd be one 
%um bravo two romeo five 
we have some smoke in the dining room over <background> 
two three 
%um 
and i'll stay there so that means i have an extra one for the next turn right 
okay 
so then i roll the dice 
okay so that's 
okay copy that entering the kid's bedroom taking out some fire turning this into smoke alright kid's bedroom almost clear reassessing for fire bravo three <background>

awesome okay 
over 
okay i'm in the living room and it mostly fire so i'm going to attempt to 
get rid of some of the fire because i don't want anymore explosions to happen 
so i'm going to put out this fire in the living room and i'm going to 
move and put out another fire in the living room and i'm also going to take this smoke away 
%uh over oh wait i have to let's see if this fire spreads 
oh no it %uh the fire has hit some smoke in the 
dining room

forget what i just said 
alright i am actually going to %uh move to this point of interest in the bathroom i think there might be a person in there so i'm going to 
actually move and create some damage so that i can 
get through to the point of interest 
%uh and 
it's a dog i'm going to grab the dog so that we can leave and get out of this house but %uh i'm out of energy right now so i'm going to 
i'm going to chill for a bit and hopefully this fire doesn't spread let's see 
alright so %uh there's some smoke in the master bedroom but it doesn't look like 
anybody is in there so i'm going to leave it for now and %uh i'll get this dog out of here 
over 
alright %uh i'm going to move and get this dog out of here 
%um 
alright i'm going to 
make my way through the living room i'm %uh 
two moves to move with someone actually you know what i'm going to do i am going to make some damage in this master bath so we can get the freak out of here with this dog 
so i'm going to move towards the wall %uh and then i'm going to use the rest of my energy to bust down this wall 
ah it's two so i'm going to actually %uh yeah i'm i'm working on this hole 
%uh alright let's hope this fire doesn't spread 
oh (())  okay 
%uh so the kitchen table is actually covered in smoke but that's surrounded by fire so we'll let engulf it will engulf and i think this one is also actually supposed to no it's fine we're good 
alright %uh over 
alright i'm going to actually create some more damage in this master bath so i can get this dog out of here %uh and the dog is safely outside 
i'm going to put him in the street 
%uh over 
wait oh let me see if %uh hopefully this fire doesn't spread while i'm outside 
and of course %uh 
it created an explosion 
%um 
so %uh it looks like the fire is spreading in the kitchen and it's actually busted down the door 
between the kitchen and the living room which is actually kind of good for us i think but %um 
yeah the kitchen is almost completely engulfed in fire now over 
oh yes yes 
%uh there's a new point of interest in the kid's bedroom 
%uh right next to a fire so we might want to make our way there in case anything happens it looks like there's also maybe somebody in the bathroom next door so maybe we can check both of those out 
over 
good job green firefighter 
alright 
%uh i'll i'll go work on the kitchen so that it doesn't %uh spread throughout the rest of the house while hopefully you get those people out of here 
okay alright i'm going to i'm actually going to enter from the living room again %uh and i'm going to put out this fire and %uh yeah i'm going to just put out that fire i'm going to save some of my energy for when i actually get in the kitchen so hopefully i can take out a bunch of those fires %um let's see how (()) doesn't spread it probably will (())  okay actually there's just a smoke behind me but that's okay because i have all my gear on so i'm okay over <background> 
alright %uh so %um 
alrighty i'm looking around because the kitchen is pretty engulfed right now %uh and i think i'm going to enter the kitchen 
and i'm going to take out two fires 
%uh so it's it's pretty smoky in here but i got rid of some of the fire so hopefully that'll 
help us out and i'm also going to take out some of this smoke so we can 
try and 
help the area and then i'm also going to put out one more fire 
so %uh i got about half of the kitchen clear of fire 
%uh but it it's pretty smoky so it's still kind of dangerous %uh i'm going to evaluate and see if any more of the house is going to catch and it looks like %uh 
yeah it it it's there's some more fire in the kitchen right that i just put out but %uh it's okay because i'm in here so hopefully i can 
help <background> 
that reignites the entire kitchen <background> 
okay 
oh no it's spreading so fast okay i'm surrounded by fire 
and %uh okay but worry about the people i have 
got my gear on so it's okay over 
good job green firefighter 
alright %uh i'm going to work on taking out some of this fire i'll probably actually move towards the game room and kid's bedroom so that it doesn't spread to those rooms because %uh it doesn't seem like there's anybody in the living room or the master bath so <background> 
i am going to take out this fire 
i'm going to actually take the fire near the door to the dining room as well because i don't want it to spread to any other rooms 
i'm going to move and take out this fire 
and i i'm taking out the fire on the fridge as well so %uh it looks like two ends of the kitchen are on fire but hopefully i can %uh secure the corner near the kid's bedroom 
%um 
alright so it looks like we've actually got some smoke in the master bedroom but that seems to be okay because i don't think any people are in there over 
okay %uh so 
i'm 
since we have another person of interest and you already have your arms full 
i'll head over to the dining room and see if %uh 
we can check out that 
area and see if there's anybody in it so i'm %uh going to move through this smoke i'm going to open the door up 
oops 
and i'm going to enter the dining room i can't check it to see if the person until i can move again but i'm immobile right now %uh 
and it looks like the fire is 
%uh spreading to the master bedroom 
but just a small flame and it i don't think any people are in there so %uh 
i think we're okay for now and i'll check on that person 
after i get an update from you over 
alright i'm going to move and check out this house plant there might be something there ah false alarm it was nothing 
okay %uh but i'm actually g- since i'm here i'm going to go ahead and take out the smoke that you're on so that 
you're safe 
and %um definitely will not get ignited on flames %uh and i'm going to actually make my way 
probably past you and into the kid's bedroom so that hopefully when you reenter %uh one of us can tackle this fire and one of us can get a %uh check out what's next to that toilet because i'm worried somebody's there %uh %uh let's see if this 
fire is going to spread 
oh 
freak okay so there's actually %uh 
fire where %uh on the toilet the toilet's on fire and i think there might be somebody next to it so %uh next time i'm able i'm going to check out the small bathroom over <background> 
okay so our kitchen is ablaze once more 
okay %uh copy i'm going to move to the through the kid's bedroom 
and i'm going to 
check out %uh this 
a blaze and actually now i'm going to put out the fire 
and then i will see if it's a person 
so %uh alright i i okay yeah 
i'm going to

attempt to begin breaking through with my axe 
and there appears to be 
oh i left just at the right time thankfully because smoke began appearing on the toilet that i just took the point of interest off so i think i made the right decision by taking her away over <background> 
%um 
okay 
i'm going to head towards a point of interest 
come towards him slash her 
i'm going to leave one rolling over 
one two three 
so i have one ((extra)) point rolling over i'm going to roll for a new action point i mean new point of interest

right by me 
%um attempt to contain the fire in the master bedroom and try to make my way towards the point of interest

a breach in the hole on the wall so i'm going to attempt to breach it further 
and i have an extra point left over from the last time 
so i am 
going to breach this wall 
and i'm going to begin taking care of some of the fire that is %uh near the counter top 
okay i'm going to try to douse this guy again 
he's no longer on fire 
%uh he is in my vicinity 
over 
%um 
i'm going to save the move for the next turn 
rolling for fire 
at romeo one bravo eight there's smoke developing in the master bedroom over 
however the fire continues to spread 
alright i'm going to be moving my point of interest <background> 
and there actually is an explosion in the kid's bedroom 
outside of the home so she's smoking so i guess that's okay 
that has blown out appears to have blown out the wall 
and %um i'm going to hop on and grab a hold of her ((tell her it's)) alright in addition i'm going to %um partially breach the wall and i'm going to keep an action point for next time

there is status report 
there is %um fire or smoke at bravo one romeo six 
oh shoot there is 
okay it looks like there's more damage happen- 
okay 
%uh i am going to 
actually i'm going to walk around here because if i remember correctly i don't have to use any points to walk around 
okay 
%um wait are we missing a door thing or no i just walk in okay okay i'm going to walk in <background> 
(()) four action points so i'm going to walk in 
that's one step 
there's a fire here 
i am going to extinguish the fire with two action points 
(()) <background> 
okay but if the house burns down then all the people die and i have one more point so i'm going to move forward here %um <background> 
i if i think i'm remembering correctly 
okay fire's spreading to bravo eight romeo six <background> 
so that is oh 
*boop right here over 
oh no 
it's right up next to you 
okay so 
i 
you know what i agree i think that that a point of interest would be nice 
but they're so far away so i'm going to i'm going to take out some fire before i get there 
i'm going to take out this fire with two action points 
and then i'm going to 
move with two other action points and then i'm going to go in here and get them don't worry i'm going to get them 
so 
going to be either fire or smoke but it's spreading i don't know which one it is 
it's at bravo four romeo one 
%um oh man it's in the master bath right next to the point of interest it's smoke though it's just smoke over 
no <background> 
%um i am going to <background> 
use one action point to walk over here another one to open this door 
%um i'm still in the living room so i open the door to the master bath 
and i'm going to 
take two more steps into the master bath 
now i am standing on the same place as point of interest 
but i can do no more 
%um 
okay either fire or smoke it is at bravo three romeo six 
which is in the dining room it's just smoke though but it's right next to you blue firefighter in the dining room over <background> 
that's such a problem area <background> 
okay 
i am going to turn over point of interest with one action point it's a person oh my gosh <background> 
oh is that are we fine then <background> 
okay so i got a person 
so what i'm going to do is 
take another action point 
wait 
oh it's two to move the victim okay so i just turned it over that's one moving is two i'm just going to 
hang out in this smoke with the victim because i i don't want to move with out him <background>

%um but now i do 
for next turn i will have five 
so because i want to take the victim out 
i don't care about the smoke %um 
i'm rolling 
okay bravo eight romeo one 
there is smoke in the master bedroom 
over <background> 
oh 
okay so i am moving with my victim 
one two okay so that's four action points i'm in the living room i still have an extra so next time i'm still going to have five 
%um i'm just going to go ahead and roll for the next fire 
which is at bravo one romeo five 
oh my gosh this dining room is so crazy 
%uh over 
there are three points of smoke in it 
wait me now 
okay so <background> 
not much i can do here because %uh %uh it takes two to move with the victim but i'm going to

ah it fell out okay 
next fire 
is at bravo five romeo five

point of interest 
which is going to be at bravo four romeo three 
oh is this pers- is this fine okay this point of interest is in the middle of a bunch of fire in the kitchen <background> 
okay %uh 
i still have

so i can move one space 
now i'm down to having four action points ((on)) my next round %uh i'm going to roll for next fire 
which is at bravo seven romeo one %uh in the master bedroom it's smoke right next to some more smoke over 
wait so we do we have one or two 
oh 
that is so much smoke okay so 
at this point i'm going to take one step forward use another action point to open this door 
%um and then i'm going to use a third action point to 
turn this fire into smoke 
and then a fourth to walk into that smoke because i am moving towards this point of interest 
i'm going to roll for more fire 
that's going to be at bravo seven romeo five which is %um so sad 
the- there's already fire there in the kid's bedroom so if i remember correctly that's an explosion happening 
%um so that's 
damage to the wall right here

okay so i am going to 
okay wait so i can- can i stand in the fire with the person if the person's already there okay so then i'm going to put out the fire <background> 
which is two action points 
then i'm going to 
move one space on this person %er point of interest and i'm going to turn it over 
it is a person okay but i have no extra points so 
i'll deal with it later %um 
more fire it's at bravo eight romeo six

okay 
%um we do not see anything (())  <background> 
okay 
so i am currently moving with a point of interest so that is worth two action points so i can move two steps 
i just moved into the living room which is less danger than the kitchen 
%um i'm going to roll for more fire i'm it's probably fire at this point because there's a lot of smoke on the board it is bravo one romeo six %um no it's just smoke 
good news it bad news is that it's in the dining room and there's a ton of smoke in there and you are in there blue firefighter i am sorry that you're in danger over 
no <background> 
oh 
that's so sad <background> 
oh <background> 
wait over 
oh okay so i'm moving with a point of interest so i'm going to take two steps that's four action points all the points i have but the person is out yay so i'm going to roll for another one <background>

walk around and sort of join you in this dining room area because i want to get rid of some smoke so 
moving is one action point extinguishing smoke is two 
%er i'm on my second one %um then three then four if i extinguish this one 
%um now i'm going to roll for more fire 
%uh 
bravo seven 
romeo six

how much would it take to ((repair a wall))  okay well i am going to actually exit the building and kind of come around from an other side so that's one two action points 
i'm going to come over here %um ((i feel like)) small bathroom needs some help so i'm going to use my remaining two action points to repair this wall 
%um then i'm going to roll for more fire 
%uh okay something is cropping up at bravo three romeo four which is %uh 
-- no which is in the kitchen that's an explosion because there's already fire there 
so %uh these two wall- nope three walls here are damaged and then there is more fire in the kitchen right on top of that kitchen table over 
oh <background> 
okay so 
you know what i'm going to actually enter where you just exited 
*badoop that's one action point i'm going to take one action point to extinguish this smoke 
and then take my last two to extinguish this fire 
and i'm going to roll for more danger which is at bravo four romeo two 
%um oh so sad it's just smoke but it is right in the same place as one of the points of interest in the master bath 
and that means that three of the four %um areas in the master bath have smoke in them over 
yup <background> 
you're good %um so <background> 
i am 
going to tr- hm see i don't want to 
you know what i'm just going to 
move one 
i'm going to 
fix one of these that's two action points 
again that's another action point my last one i'm going outside sorry i'm going to join you in this area so that i can also get a point of interest 
%um but that's all my action points so i can't actually move in and get one %um nope i'm going to do that again i am rolling for more fire at bravo one 
romeo four 
you know what it's smoke it's it's fine it's smoke %um it's in the living room <background>

mm mm 
okay over 
so i am actually also going to enter into the master bath %er master bedroom 
one two oh no i'm so sorry two three four that's all my action points but i'm standing with a point of interest 
in some smoke in the master bath directly next to you and i'm going to roll for some more fire

not good 
but there is a new point of interest at bravo three romeo two %um so oh fire

okay so %uh i am going to use one point one action point to turn over this point of interest it is a cat 
i would like to save this cat %um but i would also like to get rid of this smoke so i'm going to use my second action point to extinguish this smoke 
and then %um i'm going to start heading out of the master bath i'm still in there but i'm starting to leave um but i'm out of action points so i can't actually leave %um 
okay 
there is going to be %uh bravo five romeo four 
%uh it's explosion i am so sorry folks it's an explosion %um in the kitchen so there is fire here <background> 
damage here 
damage here and one of the kitchen walls is completely blown out leading to the living room and the kitchen is almost completely engulfed in flames over 
okay so i am going to use my four points to almost leave the building with my little point of interest %um 
but there's not much else i can do there %um you know what %uh do we only have two i'm going to roll for a point of interest 
%uh which is going to be at bravo three romeo two 
%um oh that's 
yikes you know that's two points of interest both in fire in the living room i am sorry that i have rolled this way 
but i will roll again for danger okay bravo seven romeo six is where 
there will be smoke in the kid's bedroom

okay so i am going to use two action points to move outside with this point of interest this point of interest is now safe i have two more points so i am going to 
walk inside and then %um move again because i am trying to get that other point of interest but i am going to roll for 
a different point of interest because i just took one off the board it was at bravo four romeo one 
%um which is in some smoke in the master bath there is a new point of interest in the master bath %um 
and there is new either smoke or fire at bravo seven romeo two it's smoke it's in the master bedroom where there already some smoke

and i don't have any banked so one 
we're or our white house in the field is also next to a river <background> 
unless you banked one 
two

i forgot i could do that alright so one two <background> 
rolling for another person of interest or 
three 
pet of interest 
brave one romeo three 
and hopefully not in the kitchen 
and then i guess i have to turn it to smoke first 
right in the fire but by the door 
so this is now smoke 
can you carry two people of interest at once okay <background> 
so that took two to get them out 
alright let's hope we don't get any more explosions over there rolling for fire 
so i'm going to check on them from the outside it is a person 
that would be four anyway it could be your whole turn <background> 
but hold on i'm still rolling 
%uh bravo three romeo six so bravo three romeo six oh <background> 
marie obama 
%um and going to turn it to smoke so she doesn't catch on fire 
we do that did or smoke did turn to fire so just be careful over there 
%um and now i'm going to roll to see where it's spreading because god forbid this fire stays 
oo 
wait romeo two bravo one 
%um wait okay just fire alright so on your way out you're going to have some fire to deal with now sorry <background> 
in place alright one and one 
(()) <background> 
so 
totally knocked out this wall 
yeah near the door well i <background> 
i am over 
starting to knock out that wall 
i'm going to this person but you can come in and it's right by a d- or actually i don't know 
got fire here and blew open this door 
well anyway you still have a couple so you decide what you want to do 
alright this is %uh 
%uh what do you mean i don't understand the question chief 
danger blue trying to get out of this fire in the living room over 
i'm not sure i guess it's kind of six of one <background> 
like in the background <background> 
oh i'm sorry i'm fine thank you so in character 
so you at least probably want to get out of there 
or you could blow this wall up 
anderson he's america's national treasure yeah <background> 
and go that way 
well <background> 
that would also use two 
you take two to move 
him 
so 
if you're going to go this direction 
bank the one 
what's your pla- well hold on what's your plan 
you'll have to bank it 
yeah so you have one left so you can't do anything 
why do you want to choose that to smoke 
just bank it 
sorry if we didn't have that fire earlier or you're roll for fire <background> 
our goal is to save the people right so or put the house out if that's your goal <background> 
oh gosh <background> 
yeah it's my fault 
i feel like that's not a big danger area right now 
yeah 
because and this is also right by a door and that we can blow that wall out so i'm just curious if that's what you want to do that's fine 
alright 
alright so <background>

oh i don't remember but <background> 
or another option is although you already moved there would just be to blow up a door there

make you know because it only takes two to blow a hole in the wall <background> 
i'm going to roll for a person of interest or 
item of interest <background> 
yeah but you have to go through all this fire too 
that's just to get a person back <background> 
it's up to you 
what did you roll for a person just to see where they are 
a person we have the opportunity to save <background> 
yeah you're already moving in that direction i guess if you had just gone out the main door <background> 
save some more people 
it would have been a little closer 
but thanks for offering to help me

yeah 
we do have a lot of fire there though 
it's a it's a it's a big wall

i'm going to use two action points to extinguish the fire in the master bath 
oh no rolling for ~POI <background> 
%um 
bravo four romeo four

%um but i'm going to gather some strength %um survey this area make sure that it's safe to enter meanwhile i'm getting some reports 
from %uh 
that there might be some possible fire spreading at bravo five romeo 
six so we've got a lot of i'm getting reports of a smoky dining room i think that might be close to w- where you are so let me know if you need any %uh backup over <background> 
mm-hm 
or would it make more sense potentially to enter through the other doorway or put out the fire through the other doorway <background> 
alright i am entering the master bath and i see a point of interest it's a girl 
%um 
i am walking towards her and i need to save my strength and and i need to think of what i'm actually going to do to 
to save %uh this person %um 
i'm pretty far from 
from most exits so i might have to break some walls down %um 
in the meantime there's some reports coming in of some more <background> 
alright we got some more fire coming in at bravo seven romeo six oh gosh 
i'm getting word of an explosion happening there's %um 
there's just 
so much happening %um does that turn into no just the door +gets open okay 
and %uh 
alright 
so i'm getting word that there is a full on inferno explosion %uh in the kid's bedroom so structurally that that's just totally ablaze %um 
there's also that a potential point of interest in the small bathroom so 
%um just getting word of that it's a bleak situation over there but i (()) nothing that we can't handle %uh 
i'm getting some more reports of some possible fire spread at oh wait i already did that great yeah there's an explosion over 
what's it look like in there green <background> 
alright i'm going to try to make my way towards that center since it seems like it's another explosion waiting to happen 
%uh i'm taking a step forward with this point of interest and i am 
putting a hole in the wall 
and i ast- %uh that's all i can do right 
%uh i'm s- still 
still waiting to save this person %um it's a tough corner i'm in but i'm going to come to get to you as soon as i can to help out 
with that blaze over there meanwhile i'm getting some more reports of the blaze 
oh gosh 
bravo eight romeo six we've got fire in the small bathroom near the point of interest over 
%uh i'm having i'm having a little bit of trouble hearing you green <background> 
things are really falling apart here it's crazy things are coming down i i need to get this person out and i need to get over to you help put these %uh flames flames out <background> 
%uh so i i made another hole in this wall and i'm dragging this person out %uh i %uh i- i- it's at 
it's a teenage girl %uh she says her name is %um martha she has smoke inhalation i'm going to need some paramedics 
here %uh i'll i- i'll but she seems fine no burns %uh just smoke %um that's that's all the energy i have right now i'm going to wait with her 
while we get some help but i plan on you know i'm going to come around the building get to you i've got 
reports of fire spreading at bravo two romeo two so that living room is just a smoky situation over 
green firefighter i'm going to use all my strength %uh to chop down a wall exit for you to get out of here with that point of interest safely 
that's all that took so much strength but i'm hoping you can get out safely and then we can get back in and fight this 
show this fire who who really runs this town 
%uh i- i'm getting more reports of smoke's spreading by bravo %uh two romeo one 
so %uh that that living room's %uh getting reports of a smoky living room but %um 
that's all i'm getting for now %uh over also i'm getting reports of another %uh point of interest 
at bravo two romeo five %uh 
so things are really happening in %uh that din- in that living room as well over <background> 
awesome alright i am getting another report of some more %uh 
%uh points possible points of interest at bravo six romeo five 
%uh 
so it looks like there's some some 
action happening in that kid's bedroom i know that we recently put out or you recently put out %um a whole bunch of fire but it looks like that's smoke 
is is clearing but %uh there's still some stuff going on in there %um i'm i'm outside the house so i think i'm going to %um i'm going to reenter through this hole 
%um and then i am 
oh jeez there's smoke in the bathroom i'm i'm getting rid of that %um and i'm i'm proceeding to 
%uh what i believe is the kid's bedroom and what do you know there's smoke in here there's i think a point of interest 
%uh i need to clean my eyes out because %uh i just need a moment %um there's a lot of smoke happening here 
%um in this small bedroom it's it's a smoky *sitch there's some more fire spreading at bravo two romeo 
three so there's %uh looks like we got a couple smoky places 
getting word of smoke in the living room of smoke in the dining room and then of course the smoke in front of me over 
alright okay i'm feeling up to the challenge there's some smoke in front of me i'm i'm putting it out 
%um i'm taking a step over 
and i'm revealing oh it's a guy it's a full grown man he is crying because there's so much smoke in here i'm going to get this put put out some of this 
%um smoke %uh 
i don't know what he's doing in this kid's bedroom but e- e- everyone there's it's pure chaos in here %um 
that's all the strength i have right now i'm going to try and come up with a safe exit plan we got some more reports of fire at bravo four romeo 
five so there's some smoke around that point of interest and i i think there might be an inferno happening on the inside the kitchen i'm getting reports that 
that is where the fire initially started because of a %uh deep frying turkey %uh situation that went awry over 
oh right <background> 
or what about %um there's you know i'm getting reports of a possible wall that's already busted down in the master bath 
with a point of interest on the other side <background> 
success <background> 
oh woo <background> 
alright 
alright i- i'm looking at this guy %uh i took a step towards him and it's the two of us now i'm taking a step back 
%uh i'm going to save some strength because i got to i got to come up with a better exit plan 
%um 
so i'm with the man in the kid's bedroom he is conscious and crying i think he has some burns %uh bravo one romeo three th- there's a lot of smoke happening in that living room 
%uh as soon as i exit the building i am going to do my best to come back around that way over 
%uh status report it looks like there is smoke filling the living room %um which is on the other side of the kitchen 
i believe the fire started in the kitchen and there is fire spread all throughout there 
we also have some %uh structural damage due to an explosion from the kid's bedroom earlier and some smoke throughout other areas of the house %uh over <background> 
nice 
i'm %uh taking a i'm going to %uh <background> 
%uh what's up 
oh right right right sorry sorry i got too excited 
alright i %uh am ra- raring to go i am taking a step forward with the this point this %um man he's still conscious 
i'm also going to just bust down this wall in front of me i don't have time for doors so 
%uh that used up a bunch of my strength i'm i'm going to just gather myself here 
%uh for a moment but i'm also getting some more reports of 
%uh fire spreading at bravo one romeo 
four i believe that there is some smoke happening by a possible point of interest %uh 
in the living room it's very smoky in there no fire yet but that that's just a disaster waiting to happen over 
alright %uh i'm exiting the building with the man i'm i'm %uh talking to paramedics now and it seems like they're going to be able to 
get him some care %uh i'm reentering 
oh i before i can even enter this living room i got to shoot some smoke out through the door 
alright and now i'm taking a step forward %uh putting out some smoke 
to the right of me and i'm revealing there is another %uh woman %uh it appears a middle age woman in the living room %um 
she's in and out of consciousness so i'm going to do my best to get her outside immediately it's very smoky in here so %uh it's just hard to breath hard to see 
%um and i'm getting some words of oh gosh there's smoke it's getting smokier by the second there's smoke right next to me on me %uh 
over 
yes %uh getting some more words of some possible other points of interest within the building at <background> 
%uh bravo eight romeo one %um so somebody possibly reports of someone in the master bathroom that's what %um some- one of the other 
%uh people points of interest told me %um at bravo two romeo five %uh there's also another possible point of interest in the dining room %um 
i guess everybody's coming out coming down from upstairs and making their way to the dining room %uh over 
alright i'm taking a step forward with %um with this point of interest i'm also going to put out this smoke behind me and i am taking another step 
forward that's all the strength i have i'm so close to the door with this %uh with this woman %um 
she says that some of her children are still inside so i'm working as fast as i can and and %uh no matter what i do smoke keeps popping up right under my feet at bravo one romeo three 
%um what are the odds %uh over 
ah 
okay <background> 
%uh <background> 
alright so i'm getting a report of a possible ~POI in the master bedroom i don't believe either one of us has made it to that corner %uh we've been battling the fires on on this side of the house %um left and right <background> 
i'm also getting %um a report of 
a possible ~POI in the small bathroom %um by the kid's bedroom where we've been knocking down walls so 
%uh that's that's about all i've got right now over 
alright %uh i'm i'm going to i think i need to try and do something about this living room but you know i've seen some fires in my day but this one is is maybe taking the cake %uh alright so 
i just put out a fire to clear a path in front of me %um 
and i'm taking a step forward and all i'm seeing is fire fire fire i can't tell where this started but 
we've got two %uh polyester couche- chairs on fire %um it almost looks like they were purposely set 
on fire but %um it's hard to see what's really going on it's smoky it smells it does smell like there's some sort of accelerant in here so i am worried about our safety and 
there's some more %uh smoke spreading right 
right by me no matter what i do bravo one romeo three is the space to be apparently %uh over <background> 
i've got a point of interest at bravo one romeo two that's right near me but i'm having trouble seeing them because %uh there's so much smoke around over 
alright i am %uh still surrounded by fire %uh so and i am getting rid of the smoke that's just forming under my feet 
and i'm getting rid of the smoke that i can and %uh 
i'm looking at a point of interest oh we got a cute puppy dog here i'm %uh taking a step forward 
and i'm still facing some flames so it might be a second before i'm able to safely exit the building i i do want to get this fire under control 
%uh meanwhile i'm getting some more reports of fire 
%uh at bravo seven romeo three %uh possible fire in %uh the game room i i 
i can't remember if you were in there earlier or not but i'm getting reports that whatever happened there it's it's %uh it's ablaze once more over 
alright %uh i'm still with this cute pup it just licked my face %uh which is really just what i needed to keep going on so 
%uh i'm turning at this fire in front of me i'm putting it out but i'm going to use %uh %uh there's still some fire i can see 
happening one of those chairs is still ablaze but i'm going to temporarily exit or make my way towards that exit in the living room 
so i can safely exit with this little pup %uh meanwhile i'm getting some words of some more fire possibly spreading at bravo eight 
romeo three %uh stuff's really happening in that game room once i %uh 
take care of this pup my my my plan of action might be to check that area out over <background> 
alright 
i'm exiting the building i just got outside safely with that pup reunited it with it's family i'm going to take another step in and another step in i think i'm %uh on the other side of
