Summary
OpenSAT20 is the second in the OpenSAT Series for speech analytic systems evaluations. OpenSAT provides an opportunity for participants to compare 
their system performance against a pool of systems performances for each task and is intended to encourage cross-learning among developers.

Simulated Public Safety Communications (PSC)
The OpenSAT20 evaluation will include the ASR, SAD, and KWS tasks for simulated first responder public safety communications. 
Participants can participate with one, two, or all three tasks.
The simulated public safety communications dataset was created by LDC and funded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
to advance first responder assistant technologies in first responder noisy and stressed environments including its effects on speech. 
The public safety communications dataset includes simulated first responder communications with and without the Lombard effect in 
speech and moments in speech with expression of urgency. The audio also includes low-level and loud background sounds typical 
in first responder events.

The simulated first responder communications is intended to be a precursor in advancing assistive technologies for real-world 
operational communications. Real-world operational data is expected to be made available in future evaluations
